apo-00b7ac967ed399fc433d57570fec527f,"Advancing bushfire arson prevention in Australia","Bushfire arson is an intractable and costly problem for Australia. This is a report from The symposium Advancing Bushfire Arson Prevention in Australia, held on 25–26 March 2010, which brought together a wide range of stakeholders to identify the gaps in current knowledge and responses to bushfire arson, and determine priorities for addressing them. Bushfire arson is a complex and multi-faceted issue. While many valuable details can be found in the papers in this report, there are several clear and overarching conclusions that can be drawn from them on how to improve bushfire arson prevention in Australia: Bushfire arson differs from structural (building) arson in important ways, including having more varied motives and less knowable consequences. It is important to understand and appreciate these differences for bushfire arson prevention and the management of bushfire arson offenders. The priority and resources given to bushfire arson in Australia need to reflect the high costs of dealing with the consequences of this crime and the much lower costs of preventing it from occurring in the first place. This is particularly urgent given the increasing risk of even higher damages in the future as a result of demographic and climate trends. There is a lot that can be done to reduce the incidence of bushfire arson in Australia, including addressing the underlying causes, implementing situational and behavioural crime prevention, increasing capture and conviction rates, and treating offenders to prevent recidivism. The earlier the intervention in the life-cycle of the crime, the lower the cost will be; however multiple approaches targeted at each of these intervention points are needed to reduce the incidence of arson. Some prevention approaches work better than others or are more effective for particular situations (such as an offender with a particular motivation). An effective – and cost effective – prevention strategy will be based on a combination approaches that are (1) tailored to the local circumstances and the specific situations or types of people that are problematic, and (2) have been shown to work. Our current knowledge and understanding of bushfire arson and the effectiveness of existing prevention approaches is insufficient for developing effective bushfire arson prevention strategies. We need to develop this knowledge by improving understanding of the risk factors for bushfire arson and its spatial and temporal patterns, and by evaluating prevention approaches. Research programs to study bushfire arson must therefore form an important part of Australia’s response to bushfire arson. Better and more accessible data is essential for the development of effective bushfire arson prevention strategies. High quality data is the basis for the development of risk assessment tools and prevention programs, and a means of understanding the cost effectiveness and outcomes of prevention and treatment programs. Data needs to be captured on all relevant fires and arson offenders through resources for more extensive investigation and referral services. Work needs to be done on understanding what data is needed, and how best to standardise, gather and present this information for both operational and knowledge development purposes. Bushfire arson requires a multi-agency and inter-disciplinary response. The responsibility for dealing with aspects of bushfire arson falls within the jurisdiction of a variety of national, state, and local agencies. In most cases, no one agency has the responsibility for coordinating bushfire arson prevention, leaving the response fragmented and inefficient. There is goodwill and recognition among people at these agencies of the need to work together on this problem. Forming state-level coordination bodies or committees, with an appropriate mandate and representatives from all relevant stakeholders, was recommended by some symposium participants. The Australian Bushfire Arson Prevention Initiative, which initiated and co-hosted the symposium, will use these conclusions as the basis for setting the Initiative goals and structuring planning over the next five years.

This study aims to explore trends in the reporting of child abuse and neglect by different reporter groups in every Australian state and territory, in the context of their relevant jurisdictional legislation. In 2012, the then Standing Council on Community and Disability Services (SCCDS) identified that the investigation of the effectiveness of Mandatory Reporting legislation in jurisdictions was a priority under the Second Action Plan (2012-2015) of the National Framework for Protecting Australia’s Children 2009-2020. This report is for government policy makers at all levels, researchers, service providers and interested stakeholders. The contracted research project required the researchers to explore, using legal research and quantitative analysis of state and territory child protection data for the period 2003-12, the reporting by different reporter groups of different types of suspected child abuse and neglect (physical abuse, sexual abuse, psychological or emotional abuse, and neglect), and the outcomes of those reports. The research project is not aimed at exploring reports by mandated or non-mandated reporters of family support issues or low-level child welfare issues, which are normally termed ‘child concern reports’.",2016-04-27,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Mandated reporter|Child abuse|Domestic violence|Child neglect|Violence|Child protection|Child sexual abuse|Family|Child|Justice|Culture|Interpersonal relationships|Human activities|Social institutions|Psychology|Data analysis|Law|Health|Behavioural sciences|Psychological abuse|Social issues|Sexual assault|Substance abuse|Health care|Crime|Abuse|Aggression|Confidentiality|Australia|Physician|Risk|Applied ethics|Ethics|Injustice|Childhood|Caregiver|Public sphere"

It includes data from  1,011 prison entrants, 437 prison dischargees, over 9,500 prisoners who visited a prison health clinic and about 9,400 prisoners who took medications. These data were provided by prisons in all states and territories in Australia except New South Wales, which provided data on prison entrants only. Participation was not complete-84% of prisons participated, with about 49% of prison entrants and 42% of sentenced dischargees in those prisons taking part. Accordingly, the information in this report needs to be interpreted with some caution. AIHW is working with the states and territories to improve the coverage of this collection. This report includes, for the first time, data on the smoke-free status of prisons, disabilities and long-term health conditions experienced by prisoners, and self-assessed health status. Mental health issues and risky health behaviours, including tobacco smoking, excessive alcohol  consumption and illicit use of drugs, continue to be the main  areas of concern. The health of Indigenous prisoners (over-represented at 27% of the prison population) is also a continuing concern. Tobacco smoking Prisoners in Australia continue to have high smoking rates compared with the general population. Almost three-quarters (74%) of prison entrants were current smokers, with 69% of entrants indicating they smoked daily. One-half (50%) of entrants who smoked on entry to prison reported that they would like to quit. Smoking bans are in varying stages of implementation in Australian prisons. Almost three-quarters (74%) of prison dischargees in prisons allowing smoking currently smoked, with one-in-six (16%) indicating that they smoked more now than they did on entry to prison. Dischargees from prisons with smoking bans were more likely to use quit smoking assistance in prison. Of those who smoked on entry to prison, dischargees from prisons with smoking bans were less likely to intend to smoke after release (59%) than those from prisons in which smoking is allowed (73%). Disability Almost one-third  (30%) of entrants reported a long-term  health condition or disability that limited their daily activities and/or affected their participation in education or employment. Limitations to daily activities were the most common (24%), followed by restrictions in employment (16%) and education (12%). About 2% of prison entrants needed help and/or supervision in the areas of self-care, mobility and/or communication. Entrants aged between 35 and 54 years were more  likely to have some form of limitation or restriction than their general community counterparts. Self-assessed physical and mental health Prisoners being discharged from prison were more likely than those entering prison to report their mental health as generally  good  or better (78% compared with 67% respectively) and less likely to report it as poor (4% compared with 8%). A similar pattern was seen in self-reported physical health, with dischargees slightly more likely to report their physical health as generally good or better than entrants (78% compared with 73%).",2015-11-30,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Sexually transmitted infection|Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme|Mental disorder|Health care|Self-harm|Indigenous Australians|Hepatitis C|Substance abuse|Infection|Hepatitis|Prison|Anxiolytic|Remand (detention)|Tobacco smoking|Alcoholism|Health|Disease|Homelessness|Detention (imprisonment)|Transsexual|Medication|Suicide|HIV/AIDS|Health sciences|Medicine|Medical specialties|Unemployment|Nursing|Australia|Medicare (United States)|Child|Mood stabilizer|Health professional|Gonorrhea|Mental distress|Medical diagnosis|Major depressive disorder|Chlamydia infection|Smoking ban|Physician|Hypnotic|Antipsychotic|Women's health|Chronic condition|Prescription drug|Clinical medicine|Long-term effects of alcohol consumption|Smoking|Employment|Human activities|Virus|Psychology|Hospital|Emergency department"

This was brought into focus by China’s decision to ban the import of foreign waste from January 2018.  Australia exports recyclable material to over 100 countries; the three main categories of which are metals, paper and cardboard, and plastics. In 2016–17, Australia exported some 4.23 mega tonnes of recycled materials, a considerable amount of which went to China. Therefore, the decision made by China to ban the import of foreign waste has a direct impact on recycling and waste management practices in Australia. One idea put forward in response to the issue of recycling and waste management is of the transition to a circular economy. Essentially, the objective of a circular economy is to maximise value at each point in a product’s life. A circular economy seeks to close industrial loops and to turn outputs from one manufacturer into inputs for another and, in doing so, reduce the consumption of virgin materials and the generation of waste. The Victorian government has also recently signalled its support for the creation of a circular economy,  as have the governments of South Australia and New South Wales. So what is the circular economy, exactly? This explainer provides an overview of the circular economy concept, what it looks like and why it’s being talked about. It also discusses recent research and developments in the circular economy space, and some of the challenges that may arise in its implementation. Additionally, it includes a number of examples from other jurisdictions where circular initiatives are being realised, and considers developments taking place in Australia.",2018-10-25,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Circular economy|Recycling|Sustainability|Waste|Zero waste|SITRA|Reuse|Resource recovery|Waste management|Economics|Natural resource|Economy|OECD|European Union|World Economic Forum|Human activities|New South Wales|Energy conservation|European Commission|Natural environment|Supply chain|Economy and the environment|Upcycling|Innovation|Finland|Research|Municipal solid waste|Economic development|Supply-chain management|Industrial ecology|Artificial objects|Sustainable development|Ecology|Germany"

These challenges are connected, so any response would benefit from a more integrated approach across and between the different levels of government.This report summarises the findings of an NCCARF-funded project that addresses this problem. The project undertook a three-way comparative case study of the 2009 Victorian bushfires, the 2011 Perth Hills bushfires, and the 2011 Brisbane floods. It collected data from the official inquiry reports into each of these events, and conducted new interviews and workshops with key stakeholders. The findings of this project included recommendations that range from the conceptual to the practical. First, it was argued that a reconceptualization of terms such as ‘community’ and ‘resilience’ was necessary to allow for more tailored responses to varying circumstances. Second, it was suggested that the high level of uncertainty inherent in disaster risk management and climate change adaptation requires a more iterative approach to policymaking and planning. Third, some specific institutional reforms were proposed that included: 1) a new funding mechanism that would encourage collaboration between and across different levels of government, as well as promoting partnerships with business and the community; 2) improving community engagement through new resilience grants run by local councils; 3) embedding climate change researchers within disaster risk management agencies to promote institutional learning; and, 4) creating an inter-agency network that encourages collaboration between organisations.

Resilience is defined as the capacity of a local community to respond to, and anticipate economic, social and environmental change and to adapt, plan and transform itself for the future. Regional Resilience – in terms of health and well-being, productivity and economic growth, managing risk, and capturing opportunities for sustainable environments and human systems – has been identified as a key strategic priority for Australia, as it has been for a number of other countries. The RRM is made up of six interlocking elements that, together, form a holistic tool and provide a composite measure. These elements are: 1. Economic Health 2. Human Capital 3. Social Well-being 4. Liveability 5. Entrepreneurialism 6. Social Capital and Social Networks The first four elements can be measured using existing data and we identify those data sources. Elements 5 and 6 can be measured using a combination of existing data and, respectively, a newly developed regional entrepreneurship survey and a newly conceived social network analysis. The RRM was developed in, and for, the Latrobe Valley and the wider Gippsland region but can be ‘rolled out’ across regional Victoria as a whole and across regional Australia.",2017-03-21,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Entrepreneurship|Quality of life|Psychological resilience|Social capital|Climate resilience|Social network|Community|Human capital|Sustainability|Economics|Innovation|Economy|Economic growth|Globalization|Health care|Research|Culture|Human activities|Capital (economics)|Natural resource|Communication|Sociology|Performance indicator|Employment|City|Ecology|Natural capital|Competition (companies)|Well-being|Australia|Obesity|Information|Social support"

Results revealed an over-representation of cognitively impaired prisoners in the sample and a large minority with concomitant mental illness or disability. Cognitively impaired prisoners were more likely to re-offend, were younger at first offence, and had greater numbers of prior offences.

The ‘alcohol problem’ is one that goes beyond the capacity of any one organisation to address. This report sees it as a ‘wicked problem’. A ‘wicked problem’ spans a number of policy arenas, is difficult to resolve, and the responsibility for which stretches across several stakeholders with different perspectives on how such a problem should be addressed. This report provides an overview of the ways in which Australian police services are adapting their systems and developing strategies to prevent and manage alcohol-related violence in and around licensed premises. The report acknowledges the diverse nature of policing across Australian states and territories. It does not attempt to compare and contrast administration or strategy across the various jurisdictions. The report is not an exhaustive study of police activity, rather a first step in identifying the strategies adopted, the boundaries within which police operate and the ‘limits to the possible’.

We first explored the current empirical literature on young parents, digital inclusion, digital literacy, parenting assistive technologies, social isolation of young mothers, online peer groups, and user perspectives on online government services. Building on this literature, we then used interviews to query the strengths and blind spots related to technology among Family Life workers and service users (i.e. young parents). We sought to identify opportunities for capitalising on the potential of technology to complement or transform existing services provided by Family Life and Life Without Barriers. In particular, we wanted to find out how social service providers could use technology to support clients, manage their organisational obligations, and access professional resources. We also wanted to find out how beneficiaries of these social services engage with digital technology, including the types, their methods of engagement and current barriers to access. We found that the young parents used resources including Facebook groups, websites and apps for information and support about parenting. However, lack of digital literacy and lack of reliable internet access were sometimes barriers to usage. Staff used technology as part of their day-to-day work, and some were comfortable showing websites and apps about parenting to young parents. However, ‘change fatigue’ and lack of digital literacy could be a barrier for staff, too. Staff saw both advantages and disadvantages to young parents’ use of digital technology. Digital technology was viewed as a potentially useful source of support, but staff noted that excessive engagement with digital technology could disrupt connection between parents and their children. Staff showed a mix of support and caution about the appropriateness of online parenting resources for clients. Both staff and clients spoke positively about the possibility of a parenting app that presented relevant information. Government online services, such as MyGov, were flagged by staff as time-consuming and difficult to understand for clients. We conclude that digital literacy cannot be assumed among young parent clients who utilise welfare and social services. We recommend building clients’ digital capacities as part of social service provision, as this would have multiple benefits. Developing an in-house online peer support group or app is a possibility, but further research is required to test viability, specifications and costings. Furthermore, we recommend several initiatives for helping clients with myGov and related government platforms.",2019-09-16,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Research|Parenting|Internet|Digital literacy|Digital divide|Mobile app|Data analysis|Digital media|Social media|Social exclusion|Technology|Social work|Support group|Friendship|Facebook|Literacy|Learning|Family|Single parent|Adolescence|Social group|Qualitative research|Social networking service|Human activities|Culture|Interdisciplinarity|Domestic violence|Health|Mass media|Innovation|Software development|Peer group|Psychology|Smartphone|Health care|Teenage pregnancy|Evaluation|Sociology|Expert|End user|Social science|Education|Emotion|Psychological concepts|Violence|Social isolation|Community|Internet access|Design|Accessibility|Communication|Information|Online community|Text messaging|Tablet computer|Mental disorder|YouTube|Caseworker (social work)|MHealth|Social network|Computer network|Evidence-based medicine|Poverty|Telecommunication|Peer support|Behavioural sciences|Interview"

Combating land degradation and restoring degraded land is an urgent priority to protect the biodiversity and ecosystem services vital to all life on Earth and to ensure human well-being. Unless urgent and concerted action is taken, land degradation will worsen in the face of population growth, unprecedented consumption, an increasingly globalized economy and climate change.

Housing is becoming increasingly important to health in light of urban growth, ageing populations and climate change. The WHO Housing and health guidelines bring together the most recent evidence to provide practical recommendations to reduce the health burden due to unsafe and substandard housing. Based on newly commissioned systematic reviews, the guidelines provide recommendations relevant to inadequate living space (crowding), low and high indoor temperatures, injury hazards in the home, and accessibility of housing for people with functional impairments. In addition, the guidelines identify and summarize existing WHO guidelines and recommendations related to housing, with respect to water quality, air quality, neighbourhood noise, asbestos, lead, tobacco smoke and radon. The guidelines take a comprehensive, intersectoral perspective on the issue of housing and health and highlight co-benefits of interventions addressing several risk factors at the same time. The WHO Housing and health guidelines aim at informing housing policies and regulations at the national, regional and local level and are further relevant in the daily activities of implementing actors who are directly involved in the construction, maintenance and demolition of housing in ways that influence human health and safety. The guidelines therefore emphasize the importance of collaboration between the health and other sectors and joint efforts across all government levels to promote healthy housing. The guidelines’ implementation at country-level will in particular contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals on health (SDG 3) and sustainable cities (SDG 11).

Abstract Strengthening community capacities is important to significantly increase community resilience after a shock. In the phase of disaster resilience, relief activities generally are focused on aid distribution, physical and economic recovery to stabilize the affected community. Yet, building the community capacity for crisis communication has not been prioritized; meanwhile it can accelerate the social capital in disaster resilience. By selecting Jalin Merapi (Merapi Circle Information Networks) in the 2010 Merapi eruption as a case study; this study captures how local communities can empower themselves through participation in providing, sharing, and verifying the information within their social network. Data has been collected by in-depth interviews with the local communities‟ members and focus-groups with appointed officials in Merapi volcano. Jalin Merapi has developed a collaborative system with community radio stations and local communities as reliable information sources and direct verifiers. A media convergence of 14 communication technologies enables a broad spread of information about refugees‟ real needs within and beyond the local communities. As the result, the refugees could receive adequate aid based on their current situation and culture. Hence, they can quickly recover themselves and furthermore foster the resilience process within the affected communities in general. Finally, this study is trying to acknowledge the challenges for strengthening the community capacity for crisis communication with bottom-up approaches, based on their knowledge and vulnerabilities in disaster resilience.",2015-03-02,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Mount Merapi|Social media|Java|Community|Volcano|Communication|Mass media|Psychological resilience|Community radio|Information|Technological convergence|Research|Sleman Regency|Natural disaster|Crisis communication|Emergency management|Culture|Human activities|Indonesia|Public sphere|Special Region of Yogyakarta|Yogyakarta|Magelang|Target audience|Media studies|Radio|Psychological concepts|Social network|Semiotics|Cognitive science|Internet|The Volcano (British Columbia)|Aid|Facebook|Types of volcanic eruptions"

When combined, different digital services make it possible to access, share and use electronic health data, including outside the healthcare domain. The public and political discussion no longer centres on the mere digitisation of patient records. A further aim is to activate people to work on improving their health using their own data. The expectation is that by controlling their data, people will be able to take charge of their healthcare. At the same time, it remains to be seen whether this will lead to better healthcare advice, whether people will actually manage their health better, and whether it is even desirable for them to control more of their data. This report shows that responsible and secure data sharing is best achieved by remaining small in scale and by focusing on what is truly necessary. It gives government, the healthcare sector and policymakers the tools they need to ensure that digital health data services are used for the benefit of a ‘socially responsible digital society’. The quality of the data and of good and appropriate healthcare are at the centre here, with people being protected against the unwanted use of their data. The report describes the outcomes of the investigation into four significant services that are emerging in parallel and that allow individuals to access, share and use health data, i.e. online portals run by healthcare institutions (which offer patients a ‘view’ into their own medical records and supporting digital programmes), health apps (‘digital coaches’), personal health environments (PHEs, a personal data vault Health at the centre 15 in which people can store and manage all their health data digitally from a single comprehensive overview), and public platforms (collective online databases, where people can share stories and health data with others).",2019-06-18,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Health care|EHealth|Electronic health record|Health data|Health professional|Medical record|Evidence-based medicine|Mental health|Research|Patient|Psychotherapy|General Data Protection Regulation|Disease|Mobile app|Decision-making|Internet|Preventive healthcare|Privacy|Health|Data analysis|Patient portal|Physical fitness|Self-care|Shared decision-making in medicine|Web portal|End user|Information|Behavior|Motivation|Scientific method|Information security|Communication|Physician|Digital health|Personally identifiable information|Multiple sclerosis|Health system|Risk|Health informatics|Medicine|Hospital|Management|Information privacy|Digitization|Prediction|Personalization|Governance|Emotion|Web application|Cognitive behavioral therapy|Psychology|Application software|Data sharing|Innovation|Data|Consent|Stress (biology)|Health technology in the United States|Reliability engineering|Addiction|Caregiver|Smartphone|Medication|Information technology|Quality of life|Cognitive science|Autonomy|Human activities|App Store (iOS)|Health insurance|Netherlands|Confidentiality|Adherence (medicine)|Clinical trial|Insurance|Technology|Empowerment|Wearable technology|Therapy|Chronic condition|Public health|Fitbit|Welfare|Best practice|MHealth|Pain"

While usually portrayed as weak and passive victims in the face of disasters, the inhabitants of these countries have always demonstrated abilities to deal with such events. Remittances, the money and goods sent by migrants back to their home country, represent one of the many mechanisms that SIDS’ populations use to overcome disasters. Yet, very little is known about remittances in a disaster context, including on their importance and role in the face of disasters, their long-­‐term effects on people’s recovery, and the implications remitting during and after such events may have on migrants who assist those in the country of origin. The large majority of studies exploring remittances have adopted economistic approaches. Most of the existing research has focused on the short-­‐term effects of remittances in the receiving areas and generally concentrated on the impacts of remittances at national, regional or even global scale. While producing relevant quantitative data on processes occurring at a larger scale, such an approach has provided little information at household or small community level. Besides, this dominant economic-­‐focused approach often overlooks the social, cultural, historical and emotional elements that shape remittances. Diverse social scientists have emphasised that remittances are not only money but also have more intangible meanings and implications. Although this more social perspective has produced a pertinent critique of economic-­‐based research exploring remittances, it has generated very little quantitative information on this mechanism, including at the local level. This thesis is a first step towards bridging this knowledge gap. The present research focuses on Samoa with the 2009 tsunami and the 2012 cyclone Evan as case studies. Using participatory techniques with disaster-­‐ affected households as well as with Samoan migrants living in New Zealand, this thesis indicates that those with access to remittances could more easily deal with emergency problems and recovered more quickly than those who have limited access to this resource. In turn, reduced access to remittances often implied strong negative effects on people’s livelihoods. This thesis emphasises that remittances reproduce or even intensify the inequalities and vulnerabilities existing pre-­‐disaster. Finally, this research shows that remitting in a disaster context may have severe economic impacts on migrants.

The final report will be prepared after further submissions and comments have been received and public hearings have been held and will be forward to the Australian Government by end May 2020. Key points: Australia's mental health: a generational shift is needed In any year, approximately one in five Australians experiences mental ill-health. While most people manage their health themselves, many who do seek treatment are not receiving the level of care necessary. As a result, too many people suffer additional preventable physical and mental distress, relationship breakdown, stigma, and loss of life satisfaction and opportunities. The treatment of mental illness has been tacked on to a health system that has been largely designed around the characteristics of physical illness. But in contrast to many physical health conditions The cost to the Australian economy of mental ill-health and suicide is, conservatively, in the order of $43 to $51 billion per year. Additional to this is an approximately $130 billion cost associated with diminished health and reduced life expectancy for those living with mental ill-health. A path for maintainable long term reform Changes recommended are substantial but they would set Australia on a path for maintainable long term reform of its mental health system. Priority reforms are identified and a staged reform agenda is proposed. Reform area 1: prevention and early intervention for mental illness and suicide attempts Reform area 2: close critical gaps in healthcare services Reform area 3: investment in services beyond health Reform area 4: assistance for people with mental illness to get into work and enable early treatment of work-related mental illness Reform area 5: fundamental reform to care coordination, governance and funding arrangements   ",2019-10-30,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Social stigma|Early childhood education|Teacher|Education|Health|Mental disorder|Mental health|School psychology|Health professional|Well-being|Psychology|Curriculum|Caregiver|Leadership|Preschool|School|Employment|Health system|Child|Family|Disease|Nursing|Screening (medicine)|Child care|Early childhood intervention|Teacher education|Disability|Community mental health service|Major depressive disorder|Risk|Evaluation|Parenting|Youth|Psychological evaluation|Evidence-based medicine|National Association of School Psychologists|Research|Health promotion|Psychotherapy|Professional development|Childhood|Indigenous Australians|School counselor|Learning|Culture|Behavioural sciences|Human activities|Legal aid|Safety|Health human resources|Presenteeism|Telehealth|Clinical psychology|Housing First|Suicide prevention|Psychiatric hospital|Substance abuse|Prison|Psychiatrist|Welfare|Alternative medicine|Substance use disorder|Health care|General practitioner|Social security in Australia|Occupational safety and health|Hospital|Supportive housing|Recovery approach|Psychiatry|Emergency department|Workers' compensation|Insurance|National Disability Insurance Scheme|Suicide|Patient|Risk management|Therapy|Psychosocial|Homelessness|Absenteeism|Social exclusion|Public health|Adolescence|Child development|Best practice|Childbirth|Productivity|Programme for International Student Assessment|Alcoholism|Australia|Pregnancy|Inclusion (education)|Income protection insurance|Behavior modification|Cognition|Psychological concepts|Primary care|Adherence (medicine)|Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme|Mother|Social work|Medicine|Comorbidity|Self-harm|Mental distress|Healthcare industry|Pediatric nursing|National qualifications framework|Mental health professional|National Health Service|Medicare (United States)|Elderly care|Victorian Health Promotion Foundation|Public hospital|Parent education program|Medical guideline|Child protection|Eating disorder|Medical diagnosis|Community health|Residential care"

However, there is often a lack of proactive evidence-based analysis of available options and their outcomes as well as indicators of success or progress. Without such analysis it is difficult to clearly gauge progress towards set goals, to improve effective policy development and implementation, and to create an active learning culture that can efficiently and effectively tackle future challenges. The present work offers an introduction to research being done to develop a policy evaluation and implementation framework that can help policy-makers produce more effective resilience policies which are sustainable over time. The term sustainable resilience has some usage in the literature but has had limited uptake and has not been formally characterised until now. This new concept creates a clear differentiation from reactive disaster resilience which is often the sole focus of urban policy development. This paper contributes to developing a working concept and guiding principles for urban sustainable resilience policy. This work suggests that sustainable resilience policy will need to take into account the complexity within and between the various systems that form cities, rapidly changing technologies, environmental conditions, and emerging forms of governance.

Additional barriers include negative and discriminatory attitudes and practices, the lack of a clear and genuine national commitment to inclusive education, insufficient support to facilitate inclusive education, and inadequate education and professional development in inclusive education for teachers and other professionals. This review of the research, in keeping with all other existing reviews and meta-analyses dating back over many decades, reveals a consistent lack of evidence to suggest any benefit of segregated education. By contrast, a considerable body of research was identified demonstrating the benefits of inclusive education. Despite these well-known findings, which have been persistent for more than half a century, current research nationally and internationally shows that segregated education not only continues, but is increasing. Building on the research base for inclusive education outlined in the first edition, this second edition consists of an extensive systematic literature review. It examines evidence across six decades and incorporates more than 400 research papers, relevant treaties and reports, to further explore the existing barriers and the possibilities for addressing these to bring about the realisation of inclusive education.

The project used a standard public health methodology endorsed by the World Health Organisation to measure the impact of gambling on quality of life.  The study found that low and moderate-risk gamblers account for a majority of the aggregate years of health life lost in Victoria. In total: 50.24 per cent of years lost to disability were from low-risk gamblers 34.52 per cent of years lost to disability were from moderate-risk gamblers 15.24 per cent of years lost to disability were from problem gamblers. Harm to self accounted for 86.2 per cent of harm, while 13.8 per cent was harm to others. When all risk categories are combined, gambling accounts for years lost to disability that equates to about two-thirds of the years lost to disability for alcohol use and dependence and major depression, and much more than many other conditions such as diabetes. The qualitative data collection identified that harms could be divided into seven dimensions: financial harm relationship disruption, conflict or breakdown emotional or psychological distress decrements to health cultural harm reduced performance at work or study criminal activity. Harms were divided into: general harms, which occurred at any time crisis harms, which were associated with attempts to seek help legacy harms, which occurred long after gambling ceased. The researchers also identified that harms could occur much later in life, or even be transferred between generations. For example, parental poverty could impact on children throughout their lifespan.",2016-04-12,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Problem gambling|Risk|Public health|Behavior|Mental disorder|Violence|Grief|Psychological trauma|Research|Harm reduction|Data analysis|Addiction|Substance abuse|Gambling|Disease|Family|Community|Preventive healthcare|Alcoholism|Disability-adjusted life year|Stress (biology)|Focus group|Health|Ecology|Alcohol abuse|Major depressive disorder|Epidemiology|Interpersonal relationship|Crime|Employment|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Health promotion|Quality of life|Education|Psychology|Suicide|Social stigma|Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|Psychological concepts|Human activities|Behavioural sciences|Social determinants of health|Disease burden|Cognition|Cognitive science|Attention|Poverty|Survey methodology|Comorbidity|Population health|Culture|Well-being|Emotion|Measurement|Anxiety|Social media|Productivity|Adoption|Quality-adjusted life year|Utility|Evidence-based medicine|Health care|Mental health|Mediation|Causality|Social network|Conceptual model|Gender|Policy|Goal|Socioeconomic status|Prison|Recidivism|Vulnerability|Quality of life (healthcare)|Binge drinking|Pathology|Homelessness|Free market|Operationalization|Tuberculosis|Rehabilitation (penology)|Psychological resilience"
apo-7e9f8408949714efdea8f8cc6456168e,"Medicines in the context of older people's lives","Background: Older people often take a relatively high number of prescription medicines and experience a range of issues linked with these medicines. Older people admitted to hospital for an acute condition often experience changes to their medicines and as a result they may experience problems such as adverse medicine events. The number of older people is increasing in New Zealand and worldwide. It is important, therefore, to understand older people's attitudes towards their medicines. Aim: The aim of this thesis is to look at medicines in the context of older people's (≥75 years) lives. It consists of two investigations. The aim of Investigation One is to explore older people's experiences of medicines over their lifetime. The aim of Investigation Two is to explore how older people, who had recently been discharged from hospital to their own home, managed medicine changes which were made during their stay in hospital.Methods: For Investigation One twenty people ≥75 were selected and interviewed using open-ended questions with an oral history approach. Participants with a range of different characteristics (e.g. age, sex, occupation, and ethnicity) were chosen.For Investigation Two, forty people aged ≥75 were recruited from two internal medicine wards in Dunedin Hospital. Participants were included in the study if they were taking four or more prescription medicines at admission, experienced a change to these medicines in hospital and were discharged to their own home. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were undertaken with participants after their discharge. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded using NVivo and analysed for themes.Results: Participants in Investigation One took a wide range of medicines (over the counter products and home remedies) in their youth but do not perceive these to be the same as their modern prescription medicines. Most participants did not begin taking regular prescription medicines until later in life and some struggled initially with this transition. Participants believe that younger people are too quick to ""run to the doctor"" and access prescription medicines in comparison to their youth.Participants in Investigation Two experienced a median of four medicine changes per person. Sixteen (40%) participants were not fully aware of all of the changes to their medicines and others had concerns about changes. The majority of participants trusted the hospital doctors and had a positive view of their stay in hospital. Many said they did not want to trouble the staff with questions about their medicines and did not necessarily think it was their place to ask questions. Participants in both investigations would rather not take medicines and at times are dismayed at the number that they do take. They trust their doctors, believe that the medicines are good for their health and, therefore, are willing to accept medicines as part of their normal lives. Conclusion: Investigation One shows the importance of understanding older people's past experiences of medicines in seeking to better understand their current attitudes to medicines. Investigation Two highlights the need to improve communication regarding medicine changes with older people at discharge from hospital. Participants from both investigations would rather not take any medicines but were willing to accept them as part of their everyday routine because they believed they were necessary and trusted their doctors.",2017-09-26,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Adherence (medicine)|Research|History|Qualitative research|Medicine|Narrative|Pharmacy|General practitioner|Polypharmacy|Medication|Alternative medicine|Memory|Prescription drug|Patient|Pharmac|Interview|Oral history|Hospital|Medical prescription|Health care|Quantitative research|Public health|Medical history|Thesis|Physician|Health care in New Zealand|Health sciences|Health|Adverse effect|Ageing|Human activities|Belief|Attitude (psychology)|Disease|Major depressive disorder|Sociology|Dementia|Over-the-counter drug|Pharmacist|Decision-making|History of medicine|Culture|Sampling (statistics)|Subsidy|Question|Social science|Reason|Short-term memory|Data analysis|Herbalism|Caversham, New Zealand"

The Melbourne Renewable Energy Project (MREP) is an innovative procurement model through which urban stakeholders across sectors are procuring renewable electricity in collaboration. Expansion of group renewable Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) among metropolitan councils of Melbourne, building on the MREP pilot, has been identified as a resilience- building activity as part of the Resilient Melbourne Strategy’s ‘adapt’ actions. This action responds to the stresses of climate change and development pressures on ecosystem services related to fossil fuel-based electricity supply, and the shocks of electricity supply disruption. This report presents research undertaken over a six-month period through collaboration between Resilient Melbourne and the University of Melbourne. Based on in-depth interviews with 27 key stakeholders across the public, private, and civil sectors and a review of relevant policy documents and reports, the research sought to understand the viability of group renewable PPAs for metropolitan Melbourne councils and thus inform Resilient Melbourne’s facilitative role in the expansion of the model. To situate group renewable PPAs in the context of urban development and governance, the City Resilience Framework (Arup 2015) is employed to understand and communicate the benefits of renewable energy procurement through an urban resilience lens. The Framework identifies elements related to the health and wellbeing of urban populations; the function and prosperity of the economy and society; the development of critical infrastructure and maintenance of the environment; and promoting leadership and long-term planning. Drawing on the MREP pilot, group renewable PPAs contribute to: Mitigating climate change impacts through emissions reductions in electricity consumption and reducing demand for fossil fuel-based electricity supply, while maintaining the use of existing grid infrastructure; Leadership and long-term planning through cross-sectoral collaboration and demonstration of a new approach to electricity procurement; Local economic development through job creation and opportunities for local businesses across the supply chain, as well as support for the renewable energy industry more broadly; and Community engagement through grant funds proportionate to the generator’s annual profits. In the context of climate change and urban resilience imperatives, group renewable PPAs represent a means through which local government, at a metropolitan scale, can take initiative and responsibility for its environmental impacts as a service to the community. Resilient Melbourne can enhance the development of this approach to energy procurement among Melbourne councils by leveraging its metropolitan scope, establishing senior-level engagement, and providing access to resources including skills, experience, and stakeholder networks.",2018-10-12,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Climate resilience|Renewable energy|Power purchase agreement|Carbon offset|Urban resilience|Electrical grid|Electricity generation|Sustainability|Procurement|Ecological resilience|Energy development|City|Low-carbon economy|Wind power|World energy consumption|Economic development|Risk|Debt|Efficient energy use|Retail|Melbourne|Greenhouse gas|Planetary boundaries|Governance|Market (economics)|Construction|Economics|Wind farm|Hydroelectricity|Victoria (Australia)|Contract|Renewable energy commercialization|Employment|Energy policy of Australia|Electricity|Air pollution|Infrastructure|Nature|Economy|Finance|Ecology|Bank|Electricity market|Psychological resilience|Demand|Energy industry|Energy|Power station|Energy market|National Electricity Market|Photovoltaic system|Renewable resource|Human activities|Supply chain|Leadership|Photovoltaics|Price|Electric generator|Energy system|Resource|National Australia Bank|Loan|Credit|Electric power transmission|Clean Energy Finance Corporation|Community|Innovation|Negotiation|Public health|Pricing|Local government|Stakeholder (corporate)"

This report focuses on this time, providing information about mothers’ employment from those with babies through to those with primary school-age children. The report provides some broad descriptive information about mothers’ employment patterns, including work hours, job contracts and occupations, in addition to the simpler measure of whether or not they are employed. It also explores how patterns vary across the characteristics of mothers and families. The report is based on the first four waves of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC), including families of children from both the B cohort (‘birth’ at Wave 1, born between March 2003 and February 2004) and the K cohort (‘kindergarten’ at Wave 1, born between March 1999 and February 2000). The data are primarily taken from reports of mothers of these children and specifically relate to characteristics of their employment at each wave.

apo-85311005002b148d0522ef6dd0066584,"The emissions gap report 2016: a UNEP synthesis report","Since 2010, United Nations Environment (UNEP) has produced annual Emissions Gap Reports based on requests by countries for an independent scientific assessment of how actions and pledges by countries affect the global greenhouse gas emissions trend, and how this compares to emissions trajectories consistent with the long-term goal of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The difference has become known as the emissions gap. In addition to estimating the emissions gap, the reports focus on key options for achieving the emissions reductions necessary to bridge the gap, and provide an assessment of how these can be accelerated and scaled up. Countries have found these emissions gap assessments useful in informing the political process. In line with previous reports, the objective of the 2016 Emissions Gap Report is to provide an up-to-date scientific assessment of the global progress towards the emissions reductions required to be on track to meet the long-term goal of the UNFCCC. In particular, this year the report emphasizes the implications of the Paris Agreement’s strengthened goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels for immediate and longer-term mitigation action (Chapters 2 and 3). In line with previous years, the report assesses actions in selected areas that can contribute to bridging the emissions gap, and how these can be accelerated and scaled up. Previous reports have covered a wide range of areas, including agriculture, forestry, and renewable energy. The areas selected this year are non-state action (Chapter 4); energy efficiency (Chapter 5); and the nexus between the Sustainable Development Goals and climate change mitigation (Chapter 6). Non-state action and energy efficiency have been examined in earlier reports, but increased political focus on these options and availability of new studies that provide better understanding of their large emissions reduction potential, in combination, provides a strong rationale for revisiting these options. Particularly, this report presents policies that have proven to accelerate energy efficiency gains in the building sector which involve: 1. Building energy codes. The existence of a building energy codes alone does not guarantee emission reductions. To ensure their effectiveness, the following principles need to also be adopted: Compliance monitoring and enforcement are essential. Typically, limited human and financial resources for this activity will be a key barrier to the successful implementation of building codes. The design of building energy codes should follow a holistic approach, covering energy performance, quality and safety, and utilisation of renewable energy. The stringency of building energy codes should be regularly revisited and strengthened. Leapfrogging to very high efficiency performance standards have also been demonstrated and avoid lock-in. 2. Building information and energy performance certification. It is recommended that before adopting energy performance certification programmes for buildings developed in the past, countries should carefully examine their stringency from the perspective of carbon lock-in, and the energy and emissions performance requirements should be brought as close to the state-of-the-art as possible. 3. Highly energy efficient buildings. These include the passivehaus standard, net-zero energy buildings, and energy positive (or e+) buildings.

The relationship between empirical evidence and theoretical developments that are presented as part of our scholarly endeavours and policy processes is rarely clear and straightforward. Sometimes, perhaps because of the fortuitous alignment of various factors, our research has a direct and positive impact on policy. Sometimes it takes longer to be noticed and have influence and, sometimes, there is no little or no evidence of impact beyond or even with the academy. And while there are things we can do to promote the existence of our work and to present it in more accessible formats to people we believe to be influential, ultimately the appreciation and application of our work lies in the hands of others. This paper is one of 164 papers that have each been reviewed and refereed by our peers and revised accordingly. While they each will have been presented briefly at the SOAC conference, they can now be read or re-read at your leisure.

A changing focus for local government in supporting communities through these renewal processes is to adopt a more facilitative and consultative role where programs and initiatives are informed by the ideas, perspectives and skills of local residents. Organisations who work with communities are increasingly utilising more collaborative approaches where the community and the administrative body work together collectively to address local issues. This study seeks to understand how local government can address place focused renewal by collaborating with communities. It aims to explore: The role of local government when working with communities, particularly in areas with a focus on local renewal; How a tool such as the ‘collective impact framework’ can be utilised by governments in community collaboration initiatives; and Key elements for success in local government led collaborations that involve a range of community stakeholders. The study includes a review of theories and approaches that support collaborative place-based approaches and innovations. These provide considerations for local governments when framing approaches to collaborate with more self-reliant and sustainable communities through the lens of community wellbeing, social justice, public value and governance. The study draws on the work of two local councils in Australia, Penrith City Council in New South Wales and Burnie City Council in Tasmania, who have responded to programs of local renewal by developing innovative and tailored local initiatives and solutions with their communities using tools to support a collaborative approach.

Summary All children in Australia have the right to an inclusive education. However, there are many barriers to the realisation of this right in the lived experience of children and families. Current efforts towards upholding the rights of all children are impeded by a lack of understanding of inclusive education and misappropriation of the term. Additional barriers include negative and discriminatory attitudes and practices, lack of support to facilitate inclusive education, and inadequate education and professional development for teachers and other professionals. Critical to addressing all of these barriers is recognising and disestablishing ableism in Australia.

If they stay in overnight, the figure rises to one in four – about 725,000 patients each year. A patient’s risk of developing a complication varies dramatically depending on which hospital they go to: in some cases, the additional risk of a complication at the worst-performing hospitals can be four times higher than at the best performers. If all hospitals lifted their safety performance to the level of the best 10 per cent of Australian hospitals, the complication rate across the nation would fall by more than a quarter. This report exposes the flaws in Australian hospitals’ safety and quality monitoring regime, and recommends reforms that could result in an extra 250,000 patients leaving hospital each year free of complications. At the moment, a veil of secrecy hangs over which hospitals and clinicians have higher rates of complications and which are safety leaders. Hospital safety statistics are collected, but they are kept secret, not just from patients but from doctors and hospitals. This has to change. Patients have a right to know the data on complication rates in different hospitals and for different procedures, so they – and their GPs – can make better-informed decisions about how and where they are treated. Doctors and hospitals need to know how they are performing compared to their peers, so that they can learn from the best-performing hospitals and clinicians. At the moment, hospital safety policies focus on only a small subset of complications classified by government as being ‘preventable’. Instead policy should be directed towards reducing all complications to the best rate achievable. This requires building up a comprehensive picture of patient outcomes, and understanding how some hospitals and clinical teams reduce all complications and achieve excellent outcomes. Private health insurers should release the information they gather on private hospitals: reducing complication rates would mean quicker recoveries and lower premiums for their members. State and territory governments should release detailed data on the performance of both public and private hospitals. This data needs to show the whole gamut of hospital performance, from catastrophic but rare errors to less harmful but prevalent complications. It should highlight the areas where there is a big gap between the best and worst performers. Governments need to set ambitious goals for every hospital – public and private – to improve their safety and quality of care. And they need to ensure the data is published widely so that patients and taxpayers can see which hospitals are improving and which are not.",2018-02-04,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Health care|Patient|Hospital|Risk|Patient safety|Surgery|Safety|Medical diagnosis|Health care quality|Knee replacement|Informed consent|Risk management|Clinical governance|Disease|Comorbidity|Cardiology|Health policy|Medicine|Medical specialties|Health sciences|Health|Estimator|Generalized linear model|Errors and residuals|Receiver operating characteristic|Normal distribution|Empirical Bayes method|Statistical model|Logistic regression|Confidence interval|Fixed effects model|Degrees of freedom (statistics)|Outlier|Bias of an estimator|Overdispersion|Standard error|Statistics|Bayesian inference|Likelihood function|Correlation and dependence|Endogeneity (econometrics)|Prior probability|Dependent and independent variables|Bayes estimator|Estimation theory|Linear regression|Random effects model|Bootstrapping (statistics)|Mean|Statistical methods|Statistical analysis|Statistical theory|Hospital readmission|Regression analysis|Shared decision-making in medicine|Decision-making|Childbirth|Clinic|Multicollinearity|Adverse effect|Randomness|Statistical inference|Variance|Central limit theorem|Governance|Sensitivity and specificity|Mean squared error|Sampling (statistics)|Parameter|P-value|Health economics|Clinical medicine|Systematic review|Patient safety organization|Statistical classification|Patient-reported outcome|National Health Service|Audit|Box plot|Accuracy and precision|Prediction|Research|Numerical integration|Attention|Robust statistics|Bariatric surgery|Pneumonia|Mathematical and quantitative methods (economics)|Electronic health record|Scientific method|Insurance|Outcomes research|Information|Pay for performance (healthcare)|Physical therapy|Diagnosis-related group|Health insurance"

The role of languages and cultures is seen as key in mediating and creating spaces for diverse ways of knowing and learning, believing and being, and ultimately, belonging. This is significant when we learn that more students at the school are multilingual than monolingual, and 50 percent of the students are not Catholic, but Muslim. From the perspective of students and the school community, understanding one another in terms of a Muslim and non-Muslim distinction is considered to be an overly simplistic representation of their experience of interacting in diversity.

There are also many early school leavers who do not access or enrol in vocational training as an alternative to school completion. The issues of disengagement, non-completion and disinclination to undertake vocational training were central themes in our research into the factors enabling engagement with vocational training. This research, undertaken by the Brotherhood of St Laurence Research and Policy Centre, with the assistance of the University of Melbourne’s Centre for Vocational and Educational Policy, addressed the central research question: what approaches would maximise successful entry into and engagement with vocational training for disadvantaged young people? The most recent data on completion rates for young VET students (25 years and under) without prior post-school program completion shows a completion rate in 2015 of 58.3% (NCVER 2017b). Despite the NCVER data projecting this is an increasing rate of completion from 2014 (54.9%), promoting access to and completion of VET programs for early school leavers has assumed an added urgency. This is due to both the increasingly hostile labour market confronting young people and the relative advantage those with post-secondary school qualifications have over those whose education has ended prematurely. Predominantly qualitative, our research was conducted in a total of 16 selected sites spread across three states (Queensland, Tasmania, and Victoria) that were able to provide access to disadvantaged urban, regional, and rural communities. Direct consultations were undertaken with adults working to deliver accredited training; adults in community youth organisations that support disadvantaged young people; and young people themselves. The research affirms the need to conceptualise engagement as an unfolding series of encounters — or potential encounters — between a young person and the vocational training system over time, one that can be shaped far in advance of the young person’s (potential) formal commencement. It proceeds on the assumption that a young person’s knowledge and experiences prior to their encounter with vocational training plays a very significant role in determining their (potential) training outcomes. We thus look within and beyond the confines of the training setting to identify the factors and strategies that can enhance participation and engagement. Guiding the data collection and analysis is a framework that blends socio-ecological and temporal analyses. In particular, it considers the factors at play prior to commencement, at the ‘moment’ of enrolment and, subsequently, during the actual training experience.",2017-12-05,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Vocational education|Education|Learning|Decision-making|Employment|TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training)|Research|Learning disability|Literacy|Training|Teacher|Numeracy|Autism spectrum|Motivation|Adult education|Community|Self-efficacy|Social cognitive theory|Project-based learning|Attitude (psychology)|Health|Australian Qualifications Framework|Behavior|Educational technology|Leadership|System|Australia|Pedagogy|Albert Bandura|Creative Commons license|Learning environment|Behavior modification|Cognitive science|Psychological concepts|Psychology|Human activities|Culture|Cognition|Lens (optics)|Theory|Time|Ethics|Sibling|Information|Risk|Australian Bureau of Statistics|Qualitative research|Subsidy|Technical and further education|English as a second or foreign language|Andragogy|Workforce development|Macro photography|Behavioural sciences|Causality|Social exclusion|Youth|Learning styles|Conceptual framework|Market (economics)|Public transport|Disability|Informed consent|Institutional review board|Social network|Mission Australia|Community service|Secondary education|Adelaide|Mental health|Psychological resilience|Intention|Child care|Stress (biology)|Transport|Creative Commons"
apo-9e53ff8d8fd16394fc441baf910587d2,"Dividend imputation and the Australian financial system: What have been the consequences?","Dividend imputation was introduced in Australia in 1987. Despite many theoretical and empirical studies, there is little consensus on its effects on the cost of equity capital, share prices, or investment – due primarily to different views on the consequences of international integration on equity pricing. In contrast, there appears to be general agreement on the effects on corporate leverage and dividend policy, and asset allocation strategies of investors, even though many of these effects hinge upon how international integration affects the cost of equity capital. The objective of this paper is to outline these effects, drawing on and critically reviewing the existing literature to assess what conclusions can be drawn, and causes of disagreement, on imputation’s effects on the Australian Financial System. It is concluded that imputation has provided significant benefits to the Australian economy through effects on corporate behaviour, particularly through inducing lower leverage and higher dividend payout rates, with positive implications for financial stability and market discipline of companies. Whether it has stimulated domestic physical investment is unclear – this depends upon what counterfactual tax system and rates are assumed and upon whether international integration has prevented any reduction in the cost of equity capital to Australian companies. It has had positive effects on the growth rate of the Australian equity market, relative to debt markets – reflecting both supply and demand influences. It only involves discriminatory favourable tax treatment of domestic equity investments relative to fixed interest investments (including bank deposits) if it is the case that international integration prevents any effect on the cost of equity for Australian firms. (Otherwise, an alternative classical tax system would lead to higher cash returns on equities). Shifting to a classical tax system with a company tax rate which generated equivalent government tax revenue would be likely to have distributional consequences which can be argued to be adverse to low tax-rate investors, and could have significant one-off stock price effects with consequences for capital gains and losses for investors. Because of imputation, Australia’s overall (company plus investor) tax rate on company income distributed as dividends, is lower than that in many other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, despite an apparently high corporate tax rate. On balance, the case for shifting away from an imputation system is not strong, given the beneficial effects it has on corporate financial policies. • This paper is one of three in Stage 3 of the Australian Centre for Financial Studies (ACFS) program: Funding Australia’s Future.  Initiated in 2012, this program aims to better understand the changing dynamics of the financial system and its impact on role in future economic growth. The first stage of the project, completed in 2013, analysed the interaction between suppliers of funds, financial sector participants, and end users throughout the economy.  The four papers from Stage 2 explored these issues further and provided valuable input to the Financial System Inquiry on how well Australia’s financial sector serves the economy (especially households and business), and how effectively it links the sources and uses of finance for the benefit of Australian society.  This third and final stage of the project, launched in January 2015, explored three specific challenges to the financial sector highlighted by the Financial System Inquiry, Tax System Review and Intergenerational Report. While quite diverse, each of the topics in stage 3 has a bearing on important issues for the future of the financial system and its role in serving the economy.  Stage Three was supported by a group of stakeholders comprising: Accenture, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, Challenger Limited, IBM, Industry Super Australia, National Australia Bank, Self managed Super Fund Association and Vanguard Investments, as well as the Treasury. A key objective of this project is to ensure the papers bring together a diverse range of insights and opinions from all areas of the Australian financial services sector, however in accordance with the ACFS Code of Research Conduct, the final outcomes are independent.",2015-10-21,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Dividend imputation|Dividend|Stock|Corporate tax|Tax|Rate of return|Investor|Capital asset pricing model|Investment|Share repurchase|Preferred stock|Financial market|Cost of capital|Capital gains tax|Valuation (finance)|Finance|Arbitrage|Double taxation|Debt|Short (finance)|Tax rate|Supply and demand|Yield (finance)|Security (finance)|Foreign direct investment|Equity (finance)|Leverage (finance)|Money|Microeconomics|Corporations|Corporate finance|Market (economics)|Financial economics|Financial markets|Business|Economy|Stock market|Risk|Bond (finance)|Price|Credit|Interest|Pension|Asset allocation|Subsidy|Investment fund|Diversification (finance)|Debits and credits|Economics|Superannuation in Australia|Retained earnings|Bond market|Discounting|Income tax"
apo-a01c7e25e4971d7148264078e82adeaf,"Sustained home visiting for vulnerable families and children: a review of effective processes and strategies","Parenting young children has become a more complex and stressful business, especially for those families in our community with the least resources (Grose, 2006; Hayes et al, 2010; Poole, 2004; Richardson & Prior, 2005; Trask, 2010). A widening gap exists between families that function well and those that are vulnerable. The paradox of service delivery for children and families is that vulnerable families – that is, those families with the greatest needs – are also the least likely to be able to access those services (Ghate & Hazel, 2002; Fram, 2003). A range of barriers exist for vulnerable and at risk families in making use of services (Carbone et al, 2004). One of the key barriers to vulnerable families accessing services is that many find it difficult to relate to the formal service system and are easily alienated by practices others find acceptable. Research regarding parents’ experiences of support services suggests that parents want services where they are simultaneously cared for and enabled in their role as parents, and to receive services characterised by empathy, competence, functionality, respect, flexibility and honesty (Attride-Stirling et al, 2001; Winkworth et al, 2009). Vulnerable parents fear a loss of autonomy in their interactions with support services and want services that are non-judgemental and that provide continuity of care (Ghate & Hazel, 2002; von Bultzingslowen, 2006). In addition to the barriers faced by vulnerable and marginalised families in accessing services, the system does not work in an integrated or coherent fashion to ensure that all children and families needing support receive it. Furthermore, the vast majority of services for children and families in Australia do not have an outreach function, that is, a means of engaging these vulnerable and at risk families who are in need of support but use services inconsistently or not at all. In short, the service system was not designed to meet the needs of vulnerable families within the context of a rapidly changing social and economic climate. Therefore, many families requiring support are not receiving it.",2015-02-23,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Psychotherapy|Evidence-based medicine|Family|Evidence-based practice|Health care|Social support|Stress (biology)|Health|Breastfeeding|Empathy|Self-efficacy|Expert|Child development|Adherence (medicine)|Coping (psychology)|Mental disorder|Research|Emotion|Interpersonal relationship|Problem solving|Poverty|Violence|Behavior|Patient|Trust (emotion)|Negotiation|Parenting|Risk|Empowerment|Therapy|Patient participation|Cognitive science|Emergence|Psychology|Psychological concepts|Human activities|Cognition|Behavioural sciences|Communication|Domestic violence|Attention|Neuroscience|Child neglect|Child|Brain|Therapeutic relationship|Culture|Synapse|Curriculum|Goal|Social exclusion|Motivation|Shared decision-making in medicine|Childbirth|Goal orientation|Decision-making|Attitude (psychology)|Disease|Physician|Evaluation|Metaphysics of mind|Psychosocial|Hope|Substance abuse|Mental health|Perception|Psychological trauma|Self-care|Doctor–patient relationship|Recovery approach|Knowledge|Motivational interviewing"

This study aims to explore trends in the reporting of child abuse and neglect by different reporter groups in every Australian state and territory, in the context of their relevant jurisdictional legislation. In 2012, the then Standing Council on Community and Disability Services (SCCDS) identified that the investigation of the effectiveness of Mandatory Reporting legislation in jurisdictions was a priority under the Second Action Plan (2012-2015) of the National Framework for Protecting Australia’s Children 2009-2020. This report is for government policy makers at all levels, researchers, service providers and interested stakeholders. The contracted research project required the researchers to explore, using legal research and quantitative analysis of state and territory child protection data for the period 2003-12, the reporting by different reporter groups of different types of suspected child abuse and neglect (physical abuse, sexual abuse, psychological or emotional abuse, and neglect), and the outcomes of those reports. The research project is not aimed at exploring reports by mandated or non-mandated reporters of family support issues or low-level child welfare issues, which are normally termed ‘child concern reports’.",2016-04-27,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Mandated reporter|Child abuse|Domestic violence|Child neglect|Violence|Child protection|Child sexual abuse|Family|Child|Psychology|Social institutions|Human activities|Justice|Culture|Interpersonal relationships|Psychological abuse|Sexual assault|Law|Behavioural sciences|Health care|Crime|Health|Substance abuse|Social issues|Abuse|Australia|Confidentiality|Physician|Aggression|Risk|Data analysis|Caregiver|Applied ethics|Ethics|Injustice|Jurisdiction|Nursing|Childhood|Child care|Public sphere"

The relationship between empirical evidence and theoretical developments that are presented as part of our scholarly endeavours and policy processes is rarely clear and straightforward. Sometimes, perhaps because of the fortuitous alignment of various factors, our research has a direct and positive impact on policy. Sometimes it takes longer to be noticed and have influence and, sometimes, there is no little or no evidence of impact beyond or even with the academy. And while there are things we can do to promote the existence of our work and to present it in more accessible formats to people we believe to be influential, ultimately the appreciation and application of our work lies in the hands of others. This paper is one of 164 papers that have each been reviewed and refereed by our peers and revised accordingly. While they each will have been presented briefly at the SOAC conference, they can now be read or re-read at your leisure. We hope they will stimulate further debate and discussion and form a platform for further research.

apo-ae195dcc4d66f19d04902b75579fd713,"Living and learning: research for a better built environment","Foreword: The Architectural Science Association (ASA), formally known as the Australian and New Zealand Architectural Science Association (ANZAScA), was established in 1963 with the goal of promoting architectural science, theory, education and practice. A particular focus of ASA is the development, documentation and application of innovative approaches to environmentally sustainable design. Annual conferences have been held since 1966. The built environment and our understanding of the effect that it has on our natural environment have developed dramatically over the last several decades. With the deepening evidence of the effect that humans are having on the degradation of global ecosystems, there has never been a greater need for research in the field of architectural science. The ASA2015 Conference coincides with the coming together of world leaders at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. While the aims of ASA2015 may be slightly less ambitious, they are nonetheless just as important in understanding how to develop and apply the knowledge and solutions needed to address the pressing environmental concerns of our time and the central role that the built environment has to play in this. This publication contains the 115 papers that were accepted for presentation at the 49th International Conference of the Architectural Science Association (ASA2015), hosted by the Faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning at The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia from 2 - 4 December 2015. These papers are also available individually from the ASA website (http://anzasca.net). The conference theme, Living and Learning: Research for a Better Built Environment, reflects our view of a sustainable built environment as a maturing industry and field of research, but one that we still have a lot to learn about in order to achieve real change. The role of research in improving the built environment is reflected across the 13 different themes of the conference which encompass the breadth of architectural science. Each paper in these proceedings has undergone a rigorous peer review process. Following the call for abstracts in March 2015, a total of 309 abstracts were submitted for peer review. Each abstract was double-blind peer reviewed by the International Scientific Committee, made up of members from 15 countries, across six continents. Of these, 227 abstracts were accepted for development into a full paper. There were 142 full papers submitted, each of which was then double-blind peer reviewed by two to three members of the International Scientific Committee. Based on the reviewer recommendations, 115 papers were accepted for presentation at the conference. This represents the largest number of papers ever presented at an ASA/ANZAScA conference. These proceedings, as well as the diverse range of research presented within them, are testament to the importance and diversity of the field of architectural science. This, combined with the involvement of delegates from 17 countries highlights the relevance of the Architectural Science Association, more than 50 years since it was established. We are excited to be able to welcome all conference delegates to ASA2015, particularly as this is first time in thirty-three years that the conference has been held in Melbourne. This is timely as it coincides with the construction of the new Melbourne School of Design Building, which provides a ‘living’ example of many of the theories, learnings and techniques developed within the field of architectural science.

Yet in reality there is considerable overlap, with organised criminal groups involved in various forms of volume crime.  As part of a program of work investigating the criminal histories of members of organised criminal groups, this study explores the different ways in which such offenders could be involved with volume crime and their motivations for doing so.  A typology describes eight ways in which members of organised criminal groups are involved in volume crime. These include professional organisation, methodologically sophisticated crime, covert business practices, service provision, brokerage, business protection, income generation and way of life.  Further research should quantify the extent to which members of organised criminal groups in Australia participate in these activities.",2018-12-10,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Organized crime|Crime|Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission|Cybercrime|Theft|Fraud|Possession of stolen goods|Illegal drug trade|Burglary|Police|Money laundering|Morality|Justice|Public law|Law|Common law|Deviance (sociology)|Criminal justice|Human activities|Criminal law|Misconduct|Problem behavior|Criminology|Law enforcement|Violence|Government|Assault|Robbery|Crime statistics|Darknet market|Property crime|Crimes|Association of Chief Police Officers|Australian Institute of Criminology|Applied ethics|Crime prevention|Social institutions|Business"

The 2019 report is the third comprehensive report in the series, and identifies the Great Barrier Reef Region still faces significant pressures, ranging in scale from local to global. The report finds the greatest threat to the Reef is still climate change. The other main threats are associated with coastal development, land-based run-off, and direct human use (such as illegal fishing). Since 2014, management initiatives and local actions have demonstrated positive outcomes for less complex and small scale activities, such as ports management and tourism. However, achieving outcomes on the ground continues to be difficult for complex and spatially broad threats, such as climate change and land-based run-off. Significant global action to address climate change is critical to slowing the deterioration of the Reef’s ecosystem and heritage values and supporting recovery. Such actions will complement and greatly increase the effectiveness of local management actions in the Reef and its catchment.

This loss of healthy life is called the ‘burden of disease’ in epidemiological literature. Burden of disease analysis combines living with poor health (the non-fatal burden of disease) with dying prematurely (fatal burden). Fatal and non-fatal burden combined is referred to as total burden. Burden of disease is recognised as the best method to measure the impact of different diseases or injuries in a population. This report provides estimates of the total, non-fatal and fatal burden for the Australian population in 2015, using the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) measure.

apo-c06ab2c815cbf333f655c95dad4bef2a,"Competition in Australia: Too little of a good thing?","Competitive pressure is essential to good economic performance. But many are concerned that it is waning. They say large firms are dominating markets, pushing up prices and profits, squeezing suppliers, and slowing growth in wages and productivity. They point to the consolidation of old industries and the rise of new ones dominated by large firms. Is competitive pressure in Australia weak? Is it waning? How costly to Australia is market power? This report assesses the evidence. It then proposes policies to increase competitive pressure. Large firms are not unusually dominant in Australia given the size of its economy. They do not have an unusually large share of Australian output and employment. Some large Australian markets are highly concentrated, but few are much more concentrated than in other economies Australia’s size. In a modern economy, firms in many sectors have economies of scale or network effects. That is why many sectors in Australia and elsewhere are dominated by a few large firms. The market shares of Australia’s large firms have not changed much lately, on average. Their revenues have not grown faster than GDP. A few large sectors (such as banking) have become more concentrated, while others (such as supermarkets) have become less concentrated. In a few sectors (such as media), once-mighty firms have been disrupted by new, online competitors. Other measures of competitive pressure have not changed much either: the profitability of firms in Australia has not risen much since 2000 or become more dispersed. But competition is not uniformly strong across the Australian economy. Firms earn relatively high profits in some sectors where scale economies are strong (including supermarkets, liquor retailing, mobile phone networks, and internet service provision), in some highly regulated sectors (including banking, health insurance, and gambling), and in some natural-monopoly sectors where competition is inherently weak (including wired telecoms, electricity distribution and transmission, and some airports). While profit rates suggest that there are pockets of weak competitive pressure, the economic losses are more difficult to assess because they depend on costs, not just profits. When there are just a few major firms, weak competitive pressure can permit costs to creep up, though their costs are usually still lower than those of smaller firms. Consumers probably benefit from larger firms’ economies of scale. What should policymakers do to intensify competitive pressure? Natural-monopoly regulators need to toughen regulation. Competition regulators should continue to focus on protecting competition and preventing the misuse of market power. Governments should seek to intensify competitive pressure by reducing entry barriers, including those imposed by regulation. And they should make it easier for consumers to switch between providers and control their own data.",2017-12-03,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Profit (economics)|Economics|Market power|Monopoly|Competition|Natural monopoly|Beta (finance)|Mergers and acquisitions|Economies of scale|Market (economics)|Capital asset pricing model|Transport|Innovation|Equity (finance)|Australian Competition and Consumer Commission|Retail|Business|Economy|Business economics|Economic growth|Competition law|Mobile virtual network operator|Oligopoly|Exchange-traded fund|Bank|Supermarket|Coles Supermarkets|Human activities|Australian Prudential Regulation Authority|Finance|Australia|Gross domestic product|Book value|Price|Employment|Economy of Australia|Tax|United States|Telecommunication|Economic inequality|Goodwill (accounting)"

One federal government funded strategy has injected $6.1 million dollars into Job Services Australia (JSA, now jobactive) pilot mentoring programs around the country over the past three years. These pilots have had varying rates of success, with the Department of Employment defining a positive outcome as 26 weeks job retention. One such pilot, targeting young people less than 26 years of age, was conducted between 2012 and 2015 in the Inala area of Queensland. This is an urban locale generally known to be suffering significantly high levels of disadvantage, particularly associated with low levels of education, inadequate housing, mental health issues, drug and alcohol abuse and imprisonment (Vinson, Rawsthorne, Beavis, & Ericson, 2015). A series of evaluative studies were conducted by the JSA provider, BoysTown, over the course of the three year pilot. These studies found the mentoring model used on this site, whilst not reaching Department of Employment three year indicators of success, nevertheless achieved a number of important outcomes within the three year timeframe. These included expanded bridging forms of social capital in the local Aboriginal community, achieved through overall increased engagement in the labour market by their young people. This paper describes the phases involved in assisting program clients to achieve increased rates of job seeking, placement and long-term retention, and maps the spectrum of mentoring activities required at each stage. The paper highlights the breadth of skillsets concealed within the title of “Indigenous Mentor” under this complex employment services based funding model, and argues that policy goals of increased job retention will be best achieved through the employment of more than one of these highly skilled Indigenous mentors in employment placement service offices. This paper extends existing explorations into the range of barriers to young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people’s long-term employment prospects. It focuses particular attention on the impact of extended kinship obligations on work attendance and the unique role that Aboriginal mentors are in a position to play in bridging communication breakdowns between employer and employee. It also challenges government policy settings which determine employment “success” should be measured in terms of six months job retention in a labour market environment of short-term and casual work.",2015-12-06,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Employment|Indigenous Australians|Mentorship|Survey methodology|Family|Unemployment|Research|Boredom|Motivation|Behavioural sciences|Culture|Human activities|Psychology|Cognition|Psychological concepts|Community|Entrepreneurship|Alcoholism|Australia|Psychological resilience|Negotiation|Economy|Self-report study|Evaluation|Sustainability"

It is intended to stimulate a more explicitly political consideration of disaster and DRR studies, and to ‘reroot’ disaster studies in the political realm. Consideration of DRR in conflict raises important questions about normative conceptions of and approaches to DRR, including the centrality of the state, the position of national DRR policies and institutions as the primary entry point for effective risk governance and the assumption that stability and peace are prerequisites for undertaking DRR. The review identifies important gaps in the evidence which point to potential new directions in disaster–conflict research that simultaneously build on existing normative approaches, sidestep them and adopt new approaches and perspectives, and push the boundaries of current knowledge on the relationships and interactions between DRR and conflict.",2019-05-12,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Disaster risk reduction|United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction|Hazard|Risk management|Peacebuilding|Non-governmental organization|Emergency management|Natural disaster|National security|War|Politics|Public sphere|Human activities|Culture|Violence|Climate resilience|Aid|Governance|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|Recovery approach|Government|Research|Climate change adaptation|Psychological resilience|Community|International relations|Sustainability|Social issues|Risk|Famine"

Recent industry reports argue that a shortage of people in the workforce skilled in information and communications technology (ICT) is inhibiting the growth of innovative companies around the world. Some argue that in Canada, this global challenge is exacerbated by Canadian firms’ historic tendency to adopt new technologies at a slower than average speed — a hesitancy many argue is itself the result of previous shortages of skilled technology workers. While the origins and extent of the “digital skills gap” may be the source of some disagreement, this paper argues that the existence of this gap is real, provided a gap is understood as a lack of candidates with the skills required by particular employers.

apo-c51f1910b79f259ae805da996d74fdd0,"Finding frames: new ways to engage the UK public in global poverty","The aim of the study was to explore the potential for frames theory to be used as a practical tool to re-engage the UK public in global poverty. In exploring the uses of frames theory, we have built on work by Tom Crompton at WWF-UK, who began the task of linking values to frames and thereby suggesting new ways forward for engaging the public in environmental issues and actions. An important finding from his Common Cause paper is that there is a common set of values that can motivate people to tackle a range of ‘bigger than self’ problems, including the environment and global poverty. The implication is that large coalitions can – and must – be built across third- sector organisations to bring about a values change in society. This report responds to that call. The basic argument of this paper is that there is a problem in terms of the UK public’s levels of engagement with global poverty. Simply put, people in the UK understand and relate to global poverty no differently now than they did in the 1980s. This is the case despite massive campaigns such as the Jubilee 2000 debt initiative and Make Poverty History; the widespread adoption and mainstreaming of digital communication techniques and social networks; steady growth in NGO fundraising revenues; the entire Millennium Development Goal story; and the establishment of a Westminster consensus on core elements of development policy. By many measures we have made amazing strides forward in recent years, but the public have largely been left behind. The result is that we operate within social and, by extension, political conditions that are precarious in the immediate term and incommensurate to the challenges of poverty and climate change in the medium and long term. This study looks at what can be learned from values (the guiding principles that individuals use to judge situations and determine their courses of action) and frames (the chunks of factual and procedural knowledge in the mind with which we understand situations, ideas and discourses in everyday life). Values and frames offer ways to look at the problem of public engagement with global poverty and to identify possible solutions. If we apply values and frames theory to the question of how to re-engage the public, we come up with some compelling insights into the impact of our existing practices and some striking solutions to the problems that these reveal. They may not be perfect solutions, and they bring with them significant challenges. But we believe they offer something valuable and timely: a fresh perspective. The persistent problem of public engagement suggests it is time for the development sector to transform its practices radically. Values and frames offer pathways to potential solutions that should be debated across the sector, and now",2014-09-11,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Motivation|Value (ethics)|International development|Non-governmental organization|Goal|Attitude (psychology)|Research|Poverty|Psychology|Aid|Department for International Development|Churn rate|Prosocial behavior|System|Marcel Mauss|Make Poverty History|Slacktivism|Consumerism|Culture|Human activities|Psychological concepts|Cognitive science|Qualitative research|Live 8|Cognition|Value theory|Public engagement|Development aid|Social movement|Community organizing|Thought|Internet activism|Sociology|Oxfam|Self-determination theory|Autonomy|Theory|Internet|Morality|Activism|Philosophy|Social dominance orientation|Behavior|Self|Justice|Metaphysics|Public–private partnership|Causality|Spirituality|Politics|Framing (social sciences)|Emergence|World view|Recession|George Lakoff|Community|Reason|Conformity|Jubilee 2000|Public sphere|Comic Relief|Fundraising|Trade justice|Correlation and dependence|Philosophical theories|Citizens UK|Time|Human|Charitable organization|Knowledge|Experiment"
apo-c55f90f8220aa1fc0c6b1c7d22eeec88,"The Lord Darzi Review of health and care: interim report","2018 is a year of anniversaries: 70 years since the NHS was created as part of the post-second world war social settlement; 50 years since the Seebohm Report laid the foundations for modern social care; and 10 years since High Quality Care for All was published with its sharper focus on quality of health and care. It is therefore the perfect moment to stand back and reflect on the progress that has been made, as well as the challenges that we have faced. We must also look to the future: high quality care is a constantly moving target so to stand still is to fall back. This interim report of the Lord Darzi Review of Health presents this evidence in preparation for the final report which will be published in the lead up to 70th anniversary of the NHS and will set out a long term funding and reform plan for health and care. The picture on population health over the last decade has been mixed. Important progress has been made on some metrics, notably on smoking and alcohol consumption, which have continued to decline. However, there have also been some substantial challenges. Whilst life expectancy has been growing this has been at a slower rate than the historical norm, quality of life across a number of metrics has faltered. Healthy life expectancy has failed to keep pace with life expectancy; we have seen the continued rise in mental health conditions; and there has been an outbreak of loneliness and isolation which threaten our ‘social health’. Inequalities have also started to grow once again with those at the edges of society – excluded groups such as the homeless or severely mentally ill – being hit particularly hard. Despite a decade of austerity, quality across most areas of the service – from cancer to trauma; stroke to diabetes; mental health to maternity – has been maintained or improved. Patient safety, a significant priority for the health secretary, has also got better according to most metrics. Progress is also apparent in social care with both self-reported outcomes and CQC ratings showing an improvement. Yet we must not be complacent. There remains far too much variation in the quality of care: the distance between the best and the rest remains far too wide. In too many areas – cancer and mental health services, in particular – progress has been from a low base, with other countries performing significantly better. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that we are reaching a tipping point with the drivers of improvement coming up short given the pressures on the system. If quality has been maintained or improved, the same is not true for access to services. There has been a serious decline in the number of people receiving state funded social care. This has pushed more and more responsibility onto informal carers and left many without the support they need. In the NHS, timeliness on everything from ambulance responses to access to A&E to getting a GP appointment has deteriorated. The stress on the whole system – primary and community services, acute care and social care – is vividly illustrated by the significant increase in delayed transfers of care over the period (which is even starker when we consider those medically fit for discharge). Finally, there are also signs of rationing in terms of access to new and innovative treatments as NHS patients are denied to care that is at the scientific and technological frontier.

This paper reports on one aspect of this study that maps stakeholder policymaker opinions about a future converged regulator in Indonesia. Convergence refers to a trend in regulation that seeks to define a single regulatory structure for telecommunications, broadcasting and information technology. In particular, the specific aims of this study were to examine regulatory structures with regard to two parameters derived from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU): the level of independence, and institutional design. Using benchmarking as a method, three case studies of Malaysia, South Africa and the United Kingdom were selected and evaluated using published data from the ITU. These parameters were also used to characterise the current situation in Indonesia. Indonesia's current regulatory structure is exemplified by two regulators each with primary responsibility over telecommunications and broadcasting respectively. Each of these regulatory structures is complicated by shared responsibilities across regulatory divides as well as between central and provincial jurisdictions. There is also a marked difference in the level of autonomy that each regulatory body enjoys. While the telecommunications regulator, the Indonesian Telecommunications Regulatory Body (BRTI), is closely aligned to the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MCIT) the broadcasting regulator, the Indonesian Broadcasting Commission (KPI), enjoys greater autonomy as it reports to the central legislature (DPR). In addition to these provincial offices of the KPI report to provincial legislatures (DPRD). The resultant comparative framework was used to gain advice from government experts to develop alternative strategies that are appropriate to the unique circumstances of Indonesia. While the outcomes of the study reveal a complex set of circumstances requiring further investigation the primary challenge appears to be one of selecting an appropriate level of independence for a future converged regulatory body. In conjunction with this, the outcomes move on to consider the creation of a converged regulator in relation to institutional design when addressing convergence.",2016-10-26,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (Egypt)|International Telecommunication Union|Independent Communications Authority of South Africa|Technological convergence|Ofcom|Telecommunication|Research|Telecommunications Act of 1996|Information|Indonesia|Radio spectrum|Information and communications technology|Benchmarking|Broadcasting|Autonomy|Market (economics)|Regulation|Technology|Human activities|Government|Public sphere|Case study|Indonesian Broadcasting Commission|Regulatory agency|Culture|Government of the United Kingdom|Malaysia|Information technology|Communication|Federal Communications Commission|Decision-making|Politics|United Kingdom|People's Representative Council"

The study was conducted in partnership with Uniting Communities in Adelaide, which has a strong, agency-wide commitment to invitational narrative practice and has maintained longstanding relationships with the Dulwich Centre. Uniting Communities works with men who use violence in men’s behaviour change groups and also in counselling. The agency also provides counselling and support to the partners/ex-partners of these men and their children. This study contributes to the limited evidence available on how invitational narrative approaches are used in the domestic and family violence field. The study sought to document: how invitational and narrative approaches have been taken up in the field of domestic violence; the journey of engagement from the viewpoints of men, women and practitioners; and invitational and narrative practice principles that enable behavioural and attitudinal changes in men. The following research questions guided the study: How do invitational narrative ways of working engage men who use violence in their intimate relationships?

Commercial activities of businesses are contributing to global warming through unethical social behaviours, so businesses have a role to play by adopting environmental friendly practices in their actions and strategies, so as to reduce their impact on ecosystems. Also, successful businesses to be sustainable need to consider the social concerns within their local communities. Socially friendly businesses attempt to increase human capital through skill improvement and contribute to social capital in a way that community and social groups respect their social responsibility and support them. Sustainability adoption refers to the actual implementation of sustainable practices in currently operating businesses. Such adoption in terms of ecology and community has been commonly accepted as a requirement for large businesses under the rubric of corporate social responsibility. Small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) have not been scrutinised anywhere near to the same level in terms of their attention to sustainability adoption in their business mission and strategies. Owner/managers of SMEs are no more exempt from environmental and social ethics than anyone else in society. Furthermore, SMEs are significant regional development agents contributing to the increased productivity and an improved quality of local life. Especially in Regional Australia where SMEs constitute approximately 95% of businesses in services and industry sectors, so for Regional Australian SMEs to adopt sustainability and regional economic strategies at the same time, enables local communities to benefit from sustainable development, innovation and economic development in their regions. In the SME literature, there is a lack of appreciation of the sustainability issue and its connection with its local community. Bringing together the relevant literature, this research develops a sustainability assessment framework for SMEs by determining the internal and external drivers and inhibitors affecting the adoption of social and environmental friendly practices in SMEs within the regional context. This framework can be used as a basis for application in regional development. It will also be a valuable tool for evaluation and monitoring of strategies for sustainability adoption. To gain a deep understanding of sustainability adoption by regional SMEs, this research investigates social and environmental practices adopted by regional SMEs in order to respond to the sustainability challenge. This research explores factors affecting the sustainability adoption by regional SMEs. Also the research undertaken seeks to identify whether some demographic variables (i.e. business size, business category, business age, owners/managers‟ experience and educational level) have any significant impact on the adoption of social and environmental practices. This quantitative research has a response rate of 28.77% and stands on pre-test, a pilot study and the main study. It draws on the response of 233 SME owner/managers within the regional city of Ballarat. The research uses descriptive statistics, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), analysis of variance (ANOVA), and logistic regression and is guided by the conceptual framework. The results show that the SMEs are actively engaged in employee support and they tend to be close to the local community while lacking environmental practices. However, despite being active in the areas of recycling, energy efficiency, and using environmentally friendly products, these SMEs showed an inability to grasp the strategic importance of overall environmentally sustainable policy and practice. Moreover, findings reveal that business size and owner/managers‟ education have significant positive effects on the adoption of socially responsible practices. The results of this research contribute significantly to understanding of sustainability adoption by SMEs in a regional context. This research is one of the first empirical studies undertaken to investigate the factors affecting the sustainability adoption by regional SMEs in Australia. Thus, this research builds a platform for future research in relation to understanding better the factors that are barriers to adoption of sustainable practices outside major metropolitan regions, and a theoretical framework to guide such future research. The findings of this research highlight significant implications for both theory and practice in the context of a non-metropolitan urban setting. These implications include addressing practices in a way that brings business operators together to network and collaborate with the communities in the region.",2018-03-26,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Sustainability|Research|Data analysis|Small and medium-sized enterprises|Quantitative research|Sustainable development|Brundtland Commission|Strategic management|Economic development|Economics|Triple bottom line|Ecology|Analysis of variance|Business|Adoption|Ecosystem|Employment|Human activities|Economy|Greenhouse gas|Stakeholder (corporate)|ISO 14000|Hypothesis|Qualitative research|Management|Culture|Factor analysis|Attitude (psychology)|Global warming|Science|Innovation|Research question|Sustainable business|Survey methodology|Statistics|Entrepreneurship|Natural resource|Risk management|Social science|Community|Conceptual framework|Market (economics)|Globalization|Evaluation|Business process"

The concept of recovery is explored, identifying the broad streams within it as well as considering how recovery fits within an overarching paradigm of resilience. A review of the economic impacts of disasters is undertaken, before examining in detail the impacts of disasters on small businesses. This review looks at factors influencing business recovery following a disaster and explores the intricate interconnections between business recovery and community recovery.

According to the Global Footprint Network, Australians had the eleventh largest ecological footprint amongst all world’s nations in 2014 (latest available data; datafootprintnetwork.org). The average Australian in 2014 consumed the resources of 6.89 global hectares; which means if everyone lived in the same way, it would take four planet Earths to produce the resources that would be consumed. We are already witnessing major impacts of the Australian way of living on the continent’s wildlife, forests, rivers, water supplies, coastal ecosystems and reefs, and importantly, our climate. Although there is still a long way to go for Australians to close the deficit between what we use and what is sustainable for our precious environment, there is some good news suggesting that we are on the right track. Australia’s footprint fell significantly between 2011 and 2014, from an estimated 8.80 to 6.89 global hectares per person. In contrast, over the same period, the per capita footprint in the United States of America was nearly stable from 8.54 to 8.37 global hectares per person. Making choices that impact less on the environment, and being an active participant and sharing stories about living more sustainably is not only good for the planet – it is also good for people’s health and wellbeing. Social media has enabled a huge increase in awareness of what we can do and brought sophisticated information about how to move forward to our fingertips. However, it can also bring misinformation and confusion, making informed choices more difficult for individuals as well as for organisations. Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, is committed to operating as ecologically sustainable as possible while providing high quality education enabling undergraduate and postgraduate students to gain skills and knowledge to address real world challenges.  One unit that is specifically dedicated to environmental management and sustainability is PUN015, a capstone of PU80 Master of Health, Safety and Environment. In 2017, the students undertook a group challenge – to examine sustainability features and opportunities and recommend tools for auditing sustainability performance at their own campus and business area at Kelvin Grove Campus and Village. This report presents the students’ combined contributions to a sustainability scoping review and recommended audit tools for Queensland University of Technology and associated businesses at Kelvin Grove Campus and Village located 6 kilometres north of the Central Business District of Brisbane, Queensland. Methods and Structure of the Report The review was conducted by 29 students of the PU80 Master of Health, Safety and Environment in the School of Public Health and Social Work, Faculty of Health, QUT between July and September 2017. The activity provided partial fulfilment of assessment requirements for PUN015 Environmental Management and Sustainability. Twenty five students chose to have their work included in this report through a signed consent process. Some requested to be named alongside their work, while others preferred to only be named on the overall document. In producing this review, the students first collectively discussed the most likely major categories of the human ‘ecological footprint’ at Kelvin Grove, i.e. environmental damage or depletion associated with consumption and/or pollution occurring through university and business activities, as well as by staff and students in their everyday lives. They also discussed ‘ecological handprints’, i.e. personal and collective behaviours and activities and knowledge sharing, development and translation into action as a result of teaching, research and social interactions in the local area via education and daily life in each area. The students then divided into five groups to research and report on key footprint/handprint categories which form the chapters of this report; namely people, water, food, energy and waste. Each group then further sub-divided their category into more specific components to enable each student to contribute an independent, topic report to be included as a section in each chapter. These detail recent evidence on key environmental aspects and impacts on sustainability with relevance to Kelvin Grove campus and local businesses. Students also developed new tools or identified appropriate existing tools that could be used to audit the current and future status of sustainability efforts on campus. These are placed in the Appendix of the full report. Each section concludes with suggestions and recommendations for improvements that could be made to reduce the footprint and increase the handprint of Kelvin Grove campus and village.

Australia, along with New Zealand, were highlighted as “leaders in closing the gender gap”. Based on the W.E.F’s benchmarking tool, the Gender Gap Index (G.G.I.), Australia achieved a rank of 15, out of 115 countries, and a score of 0.716 (1=equality). Perhaps unsurprisingly the Report has prompted considerable debate in Australia as to the status of women and, in particular, their economic well-being. Whilst many women have benefited from access to education and health, persistent barriers continue to hinder women’s economic opportunities and political empowerment within the Australian context. At a time when other countries are integrating gender into the policy development process and adopting programs to monitor women’s labour market outcomes Australia appears to be moving in the opposite direction. When compared to the 1970s and 1980s it is apparent that the climate within which gender equality is pursued today has significantly chilled. In the words of Maddison and Partridge “whereas Australia was once a leader in the global struggle for gender equality [ ...] in recent years Australia has resiled from this commitment and many of the achievements of an earlier period have now been undone.” Other prominent feminist commentators such as Barbara Pocock (2003 and 2006) and Anne Summers (2003) have similarly noted recent adverse shifts in women’s labour market outcomes and a diminution over the last decade or so of the gender equity agenda by Australian governments.  Given these tensions, the W.E.F’s high praise of Australia requires closer analysis. In doing this, the paper takes as its focus the ‘Economic Participation and Opportunity Index’, a sub-Index of the G.G.I., which measures women and men’s labour market participation, remuneration, and advancement, identifying gaps and convergences.",2009-09-20,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Employment|Equal pay for equal work|Gender pay gap|Workforce|Parental leave|Labour economics|Economics|Australian Industrial Relations Commission|Gender|Unemployment|Australia|Economy|Human activities|Gender equality|Part-time contract|Economic growth|Culture|Economic inequality|Collective bargaining|Child care|Sexism|Contract|Industrial relations|Labor|Politics|Australian Bureau of Statistics|Business|Discrimination|World Economic Forum|Wage|Educational attainment in the United States|Working time|Education|Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act"

apo-fe15e0946f502719fb1ec71c449cfb11,"Individualised housing assistance: findings and policy options","This report considers the findings from an evidence-based policy inquiry into individualised forms of housing assistance which assessed whether their implementation could lead to improved services and better outcomes for low-income and vulnerable households. It sets out future policy options arising from the research and inquiry panel discussions. A diverse range of households, with varied economic and demographic profiles, are ‘in need of’ or ‘vulnerable to need for’ housing assistance. Australian and international experience indicates a number of ways in which individualisation of housing assistance can respond more sensitively to the varied needs of different population groups. Demand-side housing assistance options could incorporate tailored forms of assistance that enable intermittent support for households able to transition into employment or maintain their current housing, alongside increased support to those with ongoing and/or complex needs. Success in the Australian context requires services that are sufficiently resourced to attend to both the immediate and long term needs of clients as well as having access to longer term housing which is not only affordable but also suitable for people’s needs. Demand-side strategies will not work without attending to the well-evidenced shortage of affordable and suitable supply for very low-income households. Government has a major role in investing in this sector as the market has not produced supply at the price and of the type required. Policies to address the shortage of housing supply should be part of wider reform process that takes into account taxation and fiscal policy. Another means of individualisation is through creating markets (or quasi markets) for welfare services. This could entail private, not-for-profit and government organisations competing to provide different types of housing assistance. Housing assistance clients could have a personal budget to access the ‘bundle of assistance’ they require. There are practical difficulties in applying this approach to housing assistance which involves assets as well services. Similar to the NDIS, the assessment for such housing assistance could consider individual goals, objectives and aspirations across various aspects of life (e.g. housing, employment and education); assessment of reasonable and necessary support needs in relation to these goals; and assessment of available informal supports. A competitive culture in a multi-provider setting may provide consumers with more choice but can undermine the coherence of care and level of professional coordination. In addition, there is a risk that private agencies may reduce choice by lowering their price in the short term in order to eliminate competition. Monitoring and regulation of service quality is required to ensure service standards remain high. The extension of choice can be achieved in other ways other than through competition and the market. Another option for policy makers to extend choice is through stock transfer of public housing units to community housing agencies to enable diversity in providers and types of provision, management and links with support services. Alternatively, landlords could be encouraged to offer differential rents (depending on the length of tenancy). So for example, tenants who sign up for a long-term lease might be able to secure a reduced rent. As for the future, housing agencies will achieve the best outcomes in terms of service delivery if they can adopt a pragmatic rather than ideologically-driven market agenda. Welfare services that attend to the intrinsic factors that motivate staff to commit time and energy in providing services are more likely to achieve their objectives than those that prioritise short-term profit-maximising. The extension of choice is a desirable objective for housing agencies but the route to achieve it should be broad-based and experimental.  There is much to be gained for organisations adopting a more experimental approach to service delivery in which new approaches are piloted and then evaluated.",2016-08-30,f,"Analysis & Policy Observatory",Australia,other,aggregator,"Affordable housing|National Disability Insurance Scheme|Public housing|Poverty|Employment|Subsidy|Welfare|Goal|Disability|Homelessness|Innovation|Strategic management|Market (economics)|Policy|Human activities|Economy|Renting|Competition|Landlord|Market economy|Tax|Housing First|Real estate economics|Risk|Leasehold estate|Design|Evaluation|Public sphere|Research|Option (finance)|Evidence-based medicine|Accessibility|Health|Health care|Culture|Stock|Negotiation|Unemployment|Australia|Management"

These changes are taking place with striking breadth and diversity, and in ways that fundamentally affect the Arctic’s ecosystems and the lives of its inhabitants. While climate change is the most prominent driver of change, many other environmental changes are taking place alongside rapid social and economic developments. In some contexts, social, political, economic and ecological drivers may be of greater significance than climate change. Social processes driving Arctic change include increasing demand for resources and for transportation, migration, geopolitical changes and globalization. Ecosystem changes include, for example, drawdown of fish resources and degradation of Arctic landscapes. As a result, the Arctic faces multiple and simultaneous social and environmental stressors. An integral part of the assessment is to identify policy and management options. This Arctic Resilience Interim Report 2013 marks the halfway point in a process set in motion at the start of the Swedish Chairmanship of the Arctic Council. It aims to better understand the nature of critical thresholds in the Arctic and the sources of resilience in the face of environmental and social pressures, including choices that strengthen capacities to adapt and transform in the face of change. Because local changes are nested in larger-scale processes, it investigates the important interactions across scales. A core goal of this project is to better understand the combined impacts of change in the Arctic, focusing on the risk of large shifts in ecosystems services that affect human well-being. By taking an inter-disciplinary approach and analyzing the dynamics of change, the report generates crucial knowledge to inform decision-making regarding adaptation and transformation. The project has been led by the Stockholm Environment Institute and the Stockholm Resilience Centre in collaboration with the Resilience Alliance. Importantly, the project has built on collaboration with other Arctic states and the indigenous peoples in the region, as well as with several Arctic scientific organizations.",2015-12-13,f,"Arctic Council",IGO,igo,,"Socio-ecological system|Ecological resilience|Ecosystem services|Climate change adaptation|Climate resilience|System|Ecology|The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity|Ecosystem-based management|Social ecological model|Ecosystem|Natural environment|Biodiversity|Natural capital|Climate change|Governance|Regime shift|Cryosphere|Feedback|Risk|Attention|Arctic Council|Human|Global warming|Arctic|Earth sciences|Decision-making|Ocean acidification|Case study|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|Nature|Environmental science|Value (ethics)|Human activities|Sustainability|Capacity building|Systems ecology|Systems theory|Knowledge|Disturbance (ecology)|Emergence|Conceptual model|Social vulnerability|Resource|Quality of life|Science|Habitat|Cognitive science|Climate|Culture|Biogeochemistry|Evaluation|Learning|Environmental social science|Community|Economy|Permafrost|Policy|Water|Analysis|Effects of global warming|Capital (economics)|Tundra|Globalization|Management"

arcticcouncil-ee06a77f2ed2ad01b9ec4029edab6a37,"Arctic Biodiversity Synthesis.","""The Arctic holds some of the most extreme habitats on Earth, with species and peoples that have adapted through biological and cultural evolution to its unique conditions. A homeland to some, and a harsh if not hostile environment to others, the Arctic is home to iconic animals such as polar bears Ursus maritimus, narwhals Monodon monoceros, caribou/reindeer Rangifer tarandus, muskoxen Ovibos moschatus, Arctic fox Alopex lagopus and snowy owls Bubo scandiaca, as well as numerous microbes and invertebrates capable of living in extreme cold, and large intact landscapes and seascapes with little or no obvious sign of direct degradation from human activity. In addition to flora and fauna, the Arctic is known for the knowledge and ingenuity of Arctic peoples, who thanks to great adaptability have thrived amid ice, snow and winter darkness. The purpose of this Arctic Biodiversity Assessment (ABA) is to synthesize and assess the status and trends of biodiversity in the Arctic and provide a first and much-needed description of the state of biodiversity in the Arctic (see Section 0.2 in the Introduction for this assessment’s definition of the Arctic). It creates a baseline for global and regional assessments of Arctic biodiversity, and is a basis for informing and guiding future Arctic Council work. It provides up-to-date knowledge, identifies data and knowledge gaps, describes key mechanisms driving change and presents science- based suggestions for action to address major pressures. The ABA identifies current status together with historical trends in abundance and distribution where available, and includes projections of future change informed by scientific literature. It draws on a vast number of scientific publications, supplemented by ‘eye witness’ observations from indigenous peoples in the context of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK). The ABA has been through comprehensive peer review to ensure the highest standard of analysis and unbiased interpretation. The results are a benchmark against which to help measure and understand the significance of future change, without which the scope and gravity of future changes will be less clearly identifiable, undermining our ability to reduce harm. Change in the Arctic comes in many forms and from a variety of sources. Several of these stressors have been the subject of intense research and assessments documenting the effects and impacts of human activity regionally and globally, and seeking ways to conserve the biological and cultural wealth of the Arctic in the face of considerable pressures to develop its resources. These assessments have focused primarily on effects and impacts from a range of present and future stressors, such as global warming (ACIA 2005, AMAP 2009a, AMAP 2011a), oil and gas activities (AMAP 2009b), social change (AHDR 2004), marine shipping (AMSA 2009), and environmental contaminants (AMAP 1998, 2004, 2010, 2011b). The ABA, in contrast, looks not at the stressors but at the biodiversity being stressed. The ABA consists of four components: (1) Arctic Biodiversity Trends 2010 – Selected Indicators of Change, which provided a preliminary snapshot of status and trends of Arctic biodiversity (Box 1.1), (2) the present full scientific assessment of Arctic biodiversity, (3) Cycles of life: indigenous observations of change and (4) Arctic Biodiversity Assessment: Summary for Policy Makers."" /.../",2015-10-08,f,"Arctic Council",IGO,igo,,"Biodiversity|Conservation biology|Ecosystem|Tundra|Ecology|Fungus|Arctic|Climate change|Reindeer|Primary production|Global warming|Fish migration|Food web|Ecoregion|Arctic Climate Impact Assessment|Sea|Human impact on the environment|Sustainability|Plant|Parasitism|Pollution|Habitat|Ocean acidification|Invasive species|Ecological resilience|Ocean|Marine mammal|Mycorrhiza|Polar bear|Arctic Ocean|Lichen|Human|Water|Natural environment|Biogeochemistry|Organisms|Environmental science|Nature|Earth sciences|Systems ecology|Sea ice|Hunting|Wetland|Greenhouse gas|Overexploitation|Gillnetting|Physical geography|Effects of global warming|Black carbon|Fresh water|Bird migration|Protected area|Microorganism|Mammal|Bird|Climate|Life|Arctic ecology|Biology|Permafrost|Species|Disturbance (ecology)|Bering Sea|Fossil fuel|Atlantic Ocean|Bycatch|Ice|Earth|Soil|Snow|Fish|Barents Sea|Algae|Decomposition|Phytoplankton|Carbon dioxide|Seabird|Fishing|Mosquito|Oil spill|Extinction|Predation|Moose|Kittiwake|Wildlife"

cdc-aab5b167cec763775674313966f2e686,"Vital signs : Recent trends in stroke death rates -- United States, 2000–2015","Introduction: The prominent decline in U.S. stroke death rates observed for more than 4 decades has slowed in recent years. CDC examined trends and patterns in recent stroke death rates among U.S. adults aged ≥35 years by age, sex, race/ethnicity, state, and census region. Methods: Trends in the rates of stroke as the underlying cause of death during 2000–2015 were analyzed using data from the National Vital Statistics System. Joinpoint software was used to identify trends in stroke death rates, and the excess number of stroke deaths resulting from unfavorable changes in trends was estimated. Results: Among adults aged ≥35 years, age-standardized stroke death rates declined 38%, from 118.4 per 100,000 persons in 2000 to 73.3 per 100,000 persons in 2015. The annual percent change (APC) in stroke death rates changed from 2000 to 2015, from a 3.4% decrease per year during 2000–2003, to a 6.6% decrease per year during 2003–2006, a 3.1% decrease per year during 2006–2013, and a 2.5% (nonsignificant) increase per year during 2013–2015. The last trend segment indicated a reversal from a decrease to a statistically significant increase among Hispanics (APC = 5.8%) and among persons in the South Census Region (APC = 4.2%). Declines in stroke death rates failed to continue in 38 states, and during 2013–2015, an estimated 32,593 excess stroke deaths might not have occurred if the previous rate of decline could have been sustained. Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: Prior declines in stroke death rates have not continued in recent years, and substantial variations exist in timing and magnitude of change by demographic and geographic characteristics. These findings suggest the importance of strategically identifying opportunities for prevention and intervening in vulnerable populations, especially because effective and underused interventions to prevent stroke incidence and death are known to exist. Key Points: • After more than 4 decades of decline, stroke death rates in the United States have declined more slowly, stalled, or reversed among some subpopulations in recent years. • Trends in stroke death rates reversed in 2013 among Hispanics and in the South Census Region, where significant declines from year to year changed to significant increases during 2013–2015. • Thirty-eight states had an unfavorable change in the rate of decline in stroke death rates during 2000–2015. • An estimated 30,000 excess stroke deaths might have occurred because of the unfavorable changes in the rate of decline in stroke mortality during 2013–2015. • The findings emphasize the importance of continuing surveillance of stroke and strategically identifying disparities in specific risk factors, incidence, and geography that might be driving the unfavorable changes in the rate of decline so that targeted interventions can be implemented to prevent strokes in vulnerable populations. • Additional information is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/.

This supplement is the second CDC Health Disparities and Inequalities Report (CHDIR). The 2011 CHDIR was the first CDC report to assess disparities across a wide range of diseases, behavioral risk factors, environmental exposures, social determinants, and health-care access (CDC. CDC Health Disparities and Inequalities Report--United States, 2011. MMWR 2011;60[Suppl; January 14, 2011]). The 2013 CHDIR provides new data for 19 of the topics published in 2011 and 10 new topics. When data were available and suitable analyses were possible for the topic area, disparities were examined for population characteristics that included race and ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability, socioeconomic status, and geographic location. The purpose of this supplement is to raise awareness of differences among groups regarding selected health outcomes and health determinants and to prompt actions to reduce disparities. The findings in this supplement can be used by practitioners in public health, academia and clinical medicine; the media; the general public; policymakers; program managers; and researchers to address disparities and help all persons in the United States live longer, healthier, and more productive lives.",2013-11-13,f,"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)",USA,government,"healthcare agency","Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|Occupational safety and health|Health|Health equity|Preventive healthcare|White Americans|Retail|Healthy diet|Unemployment|Errors and residuals|Educational attainment in the United States|Vegetable|Confidence interval|WIC|United States|Health care|Food|Disease|Non-Hispanic whites|Employment|Current Population Survey|Chronic condition|Infant mortality|Life expectancy|Standard error|Southern United States|Poverty|Statistics|Grocery store|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Diet (nutrition)|Workforce|Northeastern United States|Socioeconomic status|Supermarket|Social determinants of health|Human activities|Risk|Economic inequality|Health sciences|World Health Organization|Dietary supplement|Weight management|Big-box store|Asthma|Demography of the United States|Public health"

Trends in the use of selected complementary health approaches are compared for 2002, 2007, and 2012, and differences by selected demographic characteristics are also examined. Methods: Combined data from 88,962 adults aged 18 and over collected as part of the 2002, 2007, and 2012 National Health Interview Survey were analyzed for this report. Sample data were weighted to produce national estimates that are representative of the civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. adult population. Differences between percentages were evaluated using two-sided significance tests at the 0.05 level. Results: Although the use of individual approaches varied across the three time points, nonvitamin, nonmineral dietary supplements remained the most popular complementary health approach used. The use of yoga, tai chi, and qi gong increased linearly across the three time points; among these three approaches, yoga accounted for approximately 80% of the prevalence. The use of any complementary health approach also differed by selected sociodemographic characteristics. The most notable observed differences in use were by age and Hispanic or Latino origin and race. Suggested citation: Clarke TC, Black LI, Stussman BJ, et al.

The study adds substantially to previous work by testing different spatial arrangements of price and calorie information. Choices were real, not hypothetical, and participants were unaware that their lunch choice was part of a study, even though their eye-movements were being tracked. Participants exposed to calorie information ordered 93 fewer calories (11%) relative to a control group. The impact was strongest when calorie information was presented on menus just to the right of the price, in an equivalent font. The difference in number of calories consumed was greater still. These effects were mediated by knowledge of the amount of calories in the meal, implying that calorie posting led to more informed decision making. There was no impact on enjoyment of the meal.

This note examines the mobilisation of the EU’s two major innovation support instruments: the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) and Horizon 2020 (H2020). Using data from Eurostat and European Commission administrative data on ESIF and H2020 funding, we observe a number of salient patterns. While newer member states benefit from higher research and innovation allocations from ESIF, participation in H2020 remains a formidable challenge. Across Europe we find that H2020 participation is closely associated with a number of proxies of the development of national and regional innovation systems. With few exceptions (most notably Slovenia and the Czech Republic) newer member states are characterised by lower overall R&D intensity, their research and innovation systems are less internationalised and most R&D is performed by public research institutions rather than businesses. Based on a review of literature on the determinants of participation in the H2020 (and its predecessor Framework Programmes), the history of today's advanced innovation systems and a consideration of the objectives of, modes of intervention of and possible complementarities between ESIF and H2020 we single out international collaboration and business innovation capabilities as important instrumental objectives for development-minded policy.",2018-11-21,f,"Publications Office of the European Union",EU,government,,"Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|Innovation|European Union|European Social Fund|Research|Research and development|Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund|Small and medium-sized enterprises|Regional policy of the European Union|Science|Governance|Business|Economics|Internationalization|Economy|Science and technology|Human activities|Scientific method|System|Science policy|Competition (companies)|Gross domestic product|Complementarity (molecular biology)|Infrastructure|Globalization|Productivity|Attention|Eurostat|Synergy|European Commission|Technology|Economic growth|Marketing"

ESDE discusses policy options that can preserve the EU’s competitiveness, sustain growth for the entire EU population and future generations, while transitioning to a climate-neutral economy. Making this a just transition requires mainstreaming social considerations upfront, in the design phase as well as in the implementation of all policies. ESDE is the European Commission’s flagship analytical report in the area of employment and social affairs, mandated by Articles 151, 159 and 161 TFEU.",2019-09-05,f,"Publications Office of the European Union",EU,government,,"Sustainability|Low-carbon economy|Productivity|Economic growth|Economics|European Union|Employment|Sustainable development|Poverty|Climate change mitigation|Unemployment|European Social Fund|Child care|Affordable housing|Labour economics|Gross domestic product|Economic inequality|Efficient energy use|Pollution|Environmental policy|Innovation|Energy poverty|Eurozone|Tax|Social partners|Sustainable Development Goals|Education|Transition economy|Air pollution|Europe|Welfare|Social exclusion|Euro|Economy|Member state of the European Union|Trade union|Human activities|Globalization|Social protection|Workforce|Macroeconomics|Risk|Economics of climate change mitigation|Social dialogue|Ageing|Market (economics)|National accounts|Governance|United States|Welfare state|Occupational safety and health|Health|Social justice|Inflation|Culture|Protectionism|Human capital|Working poor|Greenhouse gas|Natural resource|Society|Income|Household|Household income in the United States|Manufacturing|Social inequality|Gini coefficient|Finance|Socially responsible investing|Investment|Index (economics)|Middle class|Competition"

The study focuses on four countries where PRR parties have different political stances and have achieved different levels of political support, namely Germany, Denmark, Spain and Hungary. These countries also have different patterns in their industrial relations and highlight distinctive features of national trade union movement. The report has been compiled based on desk research and individual national reports from national experts, involving semi-structured interviews with trade unions. The study shows that trade unionsâ discourses and views on PRR parties differ in the countries studied. Overall, trade unions tend to be critical with PRR partiesâ agenda. However, in some countries, notably Denmark, trade unionsâ appeal to political neutrality means that critics are only focused on certain policy proposals or areas such as migration policies, and explicit critics toward PRR parties are not formulated. The study also identifies several trade unionsâ direct and indirect actions against PRR parties, particularly in Germany, where the trade union movement has developed a comprehensive set of actions to counteract the rise of PRR parties and extremist movements.",2019-09-12,f,"Publications Office of the European Union",EU,government,,"Trade union|Populism|Jobbik|Immigration|Alternative for Germany|Far-right politics|Fidesz|Employment|Unemployment|Right-wing politics|European Union|Conservatism|Political party|Welfare state|Neoliberalism|Nationalism|Denmark|Right-wing populism|Tax|Welfare|Euroscepticism|Democracy|Centrism|Spain|Germany|Workers' Commissions|European Trade Union Confederation|Left-wing politics|Liberalism|Refugee|Industrial relations|Opposition to immigration|Viktor Orbán|Hungary|Nativism (politics)|Vox (Spanish political party)|Collective bargaining|Labour economics|Gender equality|Danish People's Party|Working poor|Human activities|Political science|Public sphere|Government|Political theories|Economy|Social ideologies|Culture|Ideologies|Political ideologies|Politics|European migrant crisis|Economic inequality|Law|Unemployment benefits|Research|German Trade Union Confederation|Ideology|Globalization|Poverty|Family|Socialism|Europe|Authoritarianism|Social dialogue|Extremism|European Conservatives and Reformists|Social Democratic Party of Germany|Labour law|Gender|European Parliament|Gábor Vona|Social institutions|State (polity)|Social democracy|Health care|People's Party (Spain)|Illiberal democracy|Democratic Coalition (Hungary)|Christian Democratic People's Party (Hungary)|Overtime|Trade|Market (economics)|Left–right political spectrum"

Information effects, which made the private sector more pessimistic about future prospects of the economy and the profitability of the banking sector, were strongly present in the post-crisis period. We show that ECB communications at the press conference were crucial for the market response and that bank health benefitted from surprises, which steepened the yield curve.

europa-f50ff76c25b55b38f37a06cba6f9693d,"Mapping the role of raw materials in sustainable development goals : a preliminary analysis of links, monitoring indicators and related policy initiatives.","The UN 2030 Agenda (UN General Assembly, 2015) established 17 Goals for implementing sustainable development by acknowledging the interdependency of society, environment and economy, and by strengthening peaceful societies. The EU has a well-established development policy in place and in the New European Consensus on Development it settled a shared vision and a framework for action for development cooperation (European Union, 2017a). With this document, the EU aligned to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework. Moreover, a set of indicators to monitor the SDGs at EU level has been published (Eurostat, 2017a). Ubiquitous in modern societies and essential to economic growth and well-being, raw materials contribute to the SDGs in different ways. The production of materials can generate severe environmental and social impacts. However, their use in e.g. high tech applications, transport and energy infrastructures, construction sector, medical devices etc. demonstrates their crucial role for economic development and human wellbeing. The EU strategy on non-energy, non-agricultural raw materials tackles the challenges related to these sectors, promoting a secure and sustainable supply from domestic sources and international markets, and increasing the contribution of secondary materials. In support of this policy, the Joint Research Centre, in cooperation with DG GROW, is developing an EU knowledge base that comprises the Raw Materials Information System and the Raw Materials Scoreboard. The latter is a collection of indicators on several aspects related to the RM sectors, encompassing economic, environmental and social considerations as well as aspects related to governance and the security of supply. This study scrutinizes how raw materials hinder or contribute to the SDGs, based on literature review and experts’ opinion. It takes into consideration the whole value chain (extraction, manufacturing, use, end-of-life) of biotic and abiotic materials. In many cases, the twofold role of raw materials emerges. For instance, raw materials production originates greenhouse gas emissions, but their use in low-carbon energy technologies contributes to fight climate change. Materials extraction and manufacturing can also pollute water bodies and create water stress, but some materials are essential for environmental technologies and water treatment techniques. The outcome of the analysis stresses the potential of forestry to contribute to several SDGs, especially in relation to climate and biodiversity. However, it also highlights the importance of sustainable forest management to maintain the ecosystem services’ provision. Overall, addressing interlinkages and trade-offs between different SDGs and the various phases of the supply chains appears to be crucial for promoting sustainable development. The study also provides linkages with some current European policies and actions related to the sustainability of raw materials from extraction to consumption. In addition, we assess to what extent the SDGs are reflected in the Raw Materials Scoreboard, which monitors the main challenges of raw materials production in the EU. The Scoreboard appears to be very advanced in the area of circular economy, including various indicators and aspects. However, environmental aspects have only a partial coverage, i.e. impacts on terrestrial and marine ecosystems are not fully addressed. Other areas for potential improvements relate to gender equality and inequalities within and among countries. The efforts of the raw materials industry in promoting sustainable development could also be monitored in the Scoreboard, acknowledging SDG 17 on the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development.",2019-01-10,f,"Publications Office of the European Union",EU,government,,"Natural environment|Sustainability|Waste|Circular economy|European Union|Sustainable Development Goals|Sustainable development|Low-carbon economy|Recycling|Climate change mitigation|Mining|European Union Emission Trading Scheme|Air pollution|Greenhouse gas|Employment|Water|Forestry|Agriculture|Occupational safety and health|Pollution|Biodiversity|European Commission|Blood diamond|Waste management|Efficient energy use|Innovation|Artisanal mining|Food security|Natural resource|Water resources|Deep sea mining|Ecodesign|Economic growth|Renewable energy|Competition (companies)|Developing country|Electronic waste|Sustainable city|Human activities|Nature|Economy|Metal|Poverty|Soil|World energy consumption|Resource|European Economic Area|Drinking water|Conflict resource|Food|Ecosystem|Paris Agreement|Ecological resilience|Conservation biology|Health|Sustainable forest management|Resource efficiency|Environmental social science|Reuse|Supply chain|Forest|Aluminium|Economic inequality|Sea|Particulates|Biomass|Governance|Sanitation|Environmental degradation|Kimberley Process Certification Scheme|Metallurgy|Emissions trading|Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|Resource curse|Non-governmental organization|Life-cycle assessment|European Union Timber Regulation|Deforestation|Wood|Water scarcity|City|Common Agricultural Policy|Productivity|Infrastructure|Bioenergy|Member state of the European Union|Ecosystem services"

Thus, the purpose of the present study was to provide a comprehensive summary of the existing literature relevant to promising practices for adult offenders with central nervous system disorders.

iadb-ce62c94b09acc5e70e89ea47e5964b16,"A Blue Urban Agenda: Adapting to Climate Change in the Coastal Cities of Caribbean and Pacific Small Island Developing States","Over the past two decades, national and local governments in Caribbean and Pacific Small Island Development States have partnered with the donor community to implement over $55 billion in development programs, many of which focused on climate change adaptation. The coastal cities of the Caribbean and Pacific SIDS are among the world's most vulnerable cities to rising sea levels and coastal erosion. Currently 20% of the population of these countries, or 4.2 million people, live in low elevation coastal zones that are prone to flooding. Despite the financial burden of adapting to rising sea levels and natural hazards, SIDS are leveraging opportunities to minimize these effects through an emerging Blue Urban Agenda. This research evaluates the lessons learnt from urban coastal adaptation programs in SIDS and provides several policy recommendations to comprehensively address city resiliency to climate change. An institutional mapping of donors active in coastal adaptation in SIDS and a review of more than 50 donor-funded projects highlights the most effective coastal adaptation programs. Comparisons are provided between the Caribbean and Pacific SIDS on climate change, urban development, housing, and access to climate funds. This book provides a way forward to embark on a Blue Urban Agenda that is sensitive to the unique characteristics of SIDS and their commitments in the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action (Samoa Pathway) resolution, COP21, the Sustainable Development Goals, and Habitat III.",2017-06-07,f,"Inter-American Development Bank",IGO,igo,"development bank","Climate change adaptation|Climate change mitigation|Sustainability|Seawall|Climate resilience|Ecological resilience|Flood|Climate change|Greenhouse gas|Economic development|Inter-American Development Bank|Coral reef|Hazard|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|Coastal management|2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Sea level rise|Sea|Tropical cyclone|Effects of global warming|Air pollution|Physical geography|Economy|Earth sciences|Natural environment|Sustainable Development Goals|Caribbean|Coast|Disaster risk reduction|Biodiversity|Governance|Habitat III|Integrated coastal zone management|Tie (engineering)|Natural hazard|Wetland|Beach|Trinidad and Tobago|International development|Coastal erosion|Jamaica|Erosion|Ecosystem services|United Nations Development Programme|Sustainable development|Environmental science|United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|Mangrove|Ecology|Barbados|Capacity building|Green infrastructure|Economic growth|Asian Development Bank|Developing country"

Luego de hacer referencia a los instrumentos de fomento productivo en los que usualmente confía el sector público para reducir estas barreras, en la publicación se exploran alternativas de estímulo de una fuente específica de financiamiento privado: el crowdfunding asociado a un match de fondos públicos.

Poverty, food insecurity, low human development, poor governance and inadequate access to health and education services have exacerbated rural vulnerability which has led to the need for rural livelihood diversification.

This process could produce a positive feedback to the global warming by emitting carbon into the atmosphere in the form of methane and carbon dioxide, while the existing and future constructions on the permafrost area may be endangered by movements of the soil due to its thawing. Most studies find that additional emissions of methane from the permafrost in the 21st century probably will not strongly impact global warming. By 2100 emissions of carbon dioxide from current carbon deposits in the permafrost may significantly increase emissions of carbon dioxide, but this effect will be partly compensated by carbon deposition and storage in the newly developed vegetation over the warmer permafrost.

The objective of this project is to explore the emerging societal challenges, analyse trends in a rapidly changing digital world and launch an EU-wide debate on the possible future government models. To address this, citizen engagement, foresight and design are combined, with recent literature from the field of digital politics and media as a framework. The main research question of the project is: How will citizens, together with other actors, shape governments, policies and democracy in 2030 and beyond?

Comparing Gender and Media Equality across the Globe addresses longstanding questions in the study of gender equality in media content and media organisations across countries and over time. Drawing on data from the Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP), European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE), and the International Women’s Media Foundation (IWMF), this book offers new insights into the qualities, causes, and consequences of gender equality in and through the news media. The book contributes to the critical discussion on gender and journalism, showing that the news media do not reflect reality when it comes to the actual progress of gender equality in societies across the globe.

These issues, in turn, relate to critical strategic planning goals, such as regional equity, attractiveness, and environmental sustainability. In our research, conducted on behalf of the Nordic Working Group for Green Growth - sustainable urban regions, we tested a new methodological approach for integrating and measuring several of these dimensions. In doing so, we provided a spatial analysis of population density, service accessibility, and commuting pattern metrics of four case study areas in the Nordic Region: Funen (DK),Stockholm (SE), Tampere (FI) and Trondheim (NO). This analysis was applied with the following general principle in mind: where many types of services, public transportation and other amenities that people take benefit from in their everyday life are available within a convenient time distance, we can talk of well-functionin...",2016-05-09,f,"Nordic Council",IGO,igo,,"Geographic information system|Nordic countries|Routing|Research|Urban planning|Urban area|Accessibility|Public transport|Spatial analysis|Human activities|Computer network|Sustainability|Nordic Council|Metropolitan area|Graph (discrete mathematics)|Suburb|Map"

The WHO Global Strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol provides a menu of policy options based on international consensus, which the OECD has used as a starting point in identifying a set of policies to be assessed in an economic analysis based on a computer simulation approach. This working paper provides a comprehensive illustration of the modelling approach, input data and underlying assumptions that have been used to carry out the analyses. The policies assessed in three country settings – Canada, the Czech Republic and Germany – include price policies, regulation and enforcement policies, education programmes and health care interventions. The results of the OECD analyses show that brief interventions in primary care, typically targeting high-risk drinkers, and tax increases, which affect all drinkers, have the potential to generate large health gains. The impacts of regulation and enforcement policies as well as other health care interventions are more dependent on the setting and mode of implementation, while school-based programmes show less promise. Alcohol policies have the potential to prevent alcohol-related disabilities and injuries in hundreds of thousands of working-age people in the countries examined, with major potential gains in their productivity. Most alcohol policies are estimated to cut health care expenditures to the extent that their implementation costs would be more than offset. Health care interventions and enforcement of drinking-and-driving restrictions are more expensive policies, but they still have very favourable cost-effectiveness profiles.",2015-05-01,f,OECD,IGO,igo,,"Alcoholism|Preventive healthcare|Tax|Binge drinking|Alcoholic drink|Substance dependence|Disability-adjusted life year|Health|Cost-effectiveness analysis|Driving under the influence|Meta-analysis|Negative binomial distribution|Disease burden|Disease|Risk|Poisson distribution|World Health Organization|Systematic review|Obesity|Purchasing power parity|Simulation|Binomial distribution|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Microsimulation|Liquor|Blood alcohol content|Regression analysis|Advertising|Drink|Brief intervention|Gamma distribution|Economics|Policy|Random checkpoint|Tuberculosis|Evidence-based medicine|Naltrexone|Logistic regression|Cardiovascular disease|Prohibition|Traffic collision|Employment|Cancer|Substance abuse|Patient|Sensitivity analysis|Human activities|Epidemiology|Hepatocellular carcinoma|Medicine"

Data from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) will potentially add considerably to the understanding of the relationship between ageing and foundation skills. In particular, the fact that data from the 1994-1998 International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) and the 2003-2007 Adult Literacy and Lifeskills Survey (ALL) will be linked with PIAAC offers a unique opportunity to examine trends over time at the cohort level for a wide range of countries. Specifically, repeated measures will enable an analysis of whether there is skill gain and skill loss over the lifespan of cohorts and overtime between cohorts. This is especially important because age-skill profiles observed on the basis of a single cross-section are difficult to interpret. With this as a backdrop, this paper has sought to provide an overview of what is known about age-skill profiles and to conduct an analysis that demonstrates how trend data based on repeated cross-sectional observations of direct measures of skill at the cohort level can be used to estimate skill gain and skill loss over the lifespan and over time.",2012-03-27,f,OECD,IGO,igo,,"Fluid and crystallized intelligence|Intelligence quotient|G factor (psychometrics)|Nature versus nurture|Ageing|Literacy|Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|Human intelligence|Dementia|Cohort study|Twin|Raymond Cattell|Memory|Intelligence|Neuron|Cognition|Working memory|Cognitive science|Neuropsychological assessment|Psychological concepts|Psychology|Epistemology|Behavioural sciences|Interdisciplinary subfields|Neuroscience|Human activities|Affect (psychology)|Emergence|Culture|Phenomenology|Brain|Learning|Education|Life expectancy|Neuropsychology|Genetics|Exercise|Behavior|Old age|Psychometrics|Time|Experience|Reason|Cyprus|Flynn effect"

It provides an overview of evolving tax practice in the European Union and the United States and identifies opportunities for better alignment of transport taxes with external costs.

Distance charges offer great promise in delivering more efficient road transport. In heavily congested areas, targeted charges are a cost-effective way of reducing congestion. Fiscal objectives provide an impetus for change as improving vehicle fuel efficiency and fleet penetration of alternative fuel vehicles erode traditional tax bases, particularly those relating to fossil fuel use.

Using scenario analysis, this paper compares the global cost-effectiveness of different infrastructure strategies for the developing world to achieve universal 4G or 5G mobile broadband. Utilizing remote sensing and demand forecasting, least-cost network designs are developed for eight representative low- and middle-income countries (Malawi, Uganda, Kenya, Senegal, Pakistan, Albania, Peru, and Mexico), which provide the basis for aggregation to the global level. The cost of meeting UN Broadband Commission targets across the developing world is estimated at $1.6-1.7 trillion over the next decade, approximately 0.5-0.6% of annual gross domestic product for the developing world over the next decade.

Third, we review evidence on the types of policies that have been effective or have potential to address the different drivers.

This publication addresses this challenge head-on by providing analytical tools to policymakers in health and trade ministries alike who are involved in the liberalization agenda and, specifically, in the GATS negotiations. This book informs and assists policymakers in formulating trade policy and negotiating internationally. There is ongoing and animated international debate about the impact of GATS on public services in general and health in particular. In response, the book offers different perspectives from more than 15 leading experts. Some of the authors stress opportunities linked to trade in health services, others focus more on the risks.

The frequency and intensity of climate-induced hazards are projected to increase in the coming years, threatening the safety of households and communities, their livelihoods, and the development gains they have achieved. Further, disasters and climate change events have differential impacts on those who are socially excluded or marginalized. These groups especially include women, persons with disabilities (PwD), ethnic and religious minorities, the indigenous, the elderly, and the poor. They tend to live in higher-risk areas with increased exposure and vulnerability to natural hazards, often have limited resources to draw upon when they are struck by a disaster, and are not typically represented in decision-making bodies that deliver disaster risk management (DRM) interventions.

The government sustained its fiscal consolidation efforts in 2018 despite challenges. The current account deficit narrowed further in 2018 but portfolio capital outflows put pressure on reserves. The financial sector in Ghana has grown rapidly since 2010, and with it the share of Ghanaians with access to formal financial services, which is a measure of financial inclusion.

They have done so unevenly, however, and in ways that have accelerated climate change. Technology Transfer and Innovation for Low-Carbon Development argues that most of the emissions reductions required to achieve the Paris Agreement goals can be reached through the global deployment of existing and commercially proven low-carbon technologies (LCTs). Deploying LCTs from high-income countries—which account for 80 percent of all LCT innovations and 70 percent of all LCT exports—to developing countries, where they are needed most, will not be easy; but the evidence is clear that it can be done. Transferring LCTs is not only necessary to meet the climate targets, but it is also an opportunity to achieve development goals. The policies needed to deploy LCTs to developing countries could raise output and employment while yielding welfare benefits, such as reduced air and water pollution.

Unfortunately, most of this urban growth will take place in developing countries, where the vast majority of people remain underserved by basic infrastructure service and where city authorities are under-resourced to shift current trajectories.

How should projects be prioritized and sequenced? What opportunities emerge as a result of participating in the initiative? The authors use a network economics approach to answer some of these questions and others. Our hypothesis is that the ability of countries to maximize the benefits of BRI will depend on the position of each country in the new connectivity maps that are emerging. Ultimately, an initiative such as the BRI will change the way economic centers, as the most productive nodes in each country, are connected.
